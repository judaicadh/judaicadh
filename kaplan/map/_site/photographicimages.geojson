He was a member of the Democratic Party who served as the U.S. Representative from Alabama. Subsequently he was a prominent lawyer in Washington, D.C., much involved in the political events surrounding the American Civil War. He was secretary of Reformed Society of Israelites.\n\nPhilip Phillips was born December 17, 1807 in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Aaron Phillips and Caroline Lazarus, prominent members of the Jewish community there. His father had changed his name from Pfeiffer when he immigrated around 1800 from Ansbach, Bavaria. The family were members of the Beth Eliohim Congregation in Charleston, and in 1825 Aaron Phillips was the first president of the Reformed Society of Israelites, early leaders in the Jewish Reform movement. Philip Phillips' mother, Caroline, was the daughter of Marks Lazarus, a veteran of Fort Moultrie, the siege of Savannah, and the siege of Charleston in the American Revolution; later, he was a British prisoner of war.\n\n\n\nEducated at the Middletown Military Academy in Middletown, Connecticut, Phillips was a roommate of Thomas H. Seymour, later the hero of Chapultepec, Governor of Connecticut, Ambassador to Russia, and opponent of military action against the South. Phillips returned to Charleston in 1825 where he studied law under John Gadsden, the U.S. District Attorney, and was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1829. He then began his legal practice at the town of Cheraw, South Carolina, living with his uncle, Joshua Lazarus.\n\n\n\nFrom Cheraw, Phillips rode the circuit of the local courthouses, becoming the partner of John Coit. During the controversy in South Carolina regarding the Tariff of 1832, he was among the leaders in rallying what is now known as Chesterfield County to the Union cause, in opposition to nullification. He was a member of the Nullification Convention in the Nullification Crisis of 1832 and continued to represent Chesterfield County in the South Carolina General Assembly in 1834/35.\n\n\n\nIn 1835, Phillips began the practice of law at Mobile, Alabama, at a time when many South Carolinians were moving to that state. A year later, he returned to Charleston to marry Eugenia Levy, the sister of Phoebe Levy Pember. He was elected to the Alabama Legislature in 1844 and was Chairman of the Committee on Federal Relations. In 1840 and 1846, he published a digest of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Alabama, and in 1849 he was elected Chairman of the State Convention called for the purpose of promoting internal improvements.\n\n\n\nA delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland, Phillips gave a speech in support of Franklin Pierce who received the nomination. In 1852, Phillips was elected as U.S. Representative from Alabama's 1st congressional district to the 33rd U.S. Congress. There he was closely associated with Stephen A. Douglas and largely responsible for the final language of the portion of the notorious Kansas-Nebraska Act that specified that the Missouri Compromise of 1820 be inoperative and void for Kansas and Nebraska, but not technically repealed. In his memoirs Phillips recognized that this action probably hastened the crises of 1861.\n\n\n\nPhillips declined reelection to U.S. House, but remained at Washington, and continued his legal practice there. When the Civil War began he, being a Unionist, attempted to remain. However, his wife, Eugenia, was quite obviously a Southern sympathizer, and allegedly a Confederate spy. In August 1861, U.S. soldiers entered his house, confiscated his papers, arrested his wife and older daughters, and imprisoned them at the home of Mrs. Rose Greenhow. Fortunately, he had previously secured the friendship of Edwin M. Stanton, later Secretary of War, who, aided by other prominent Union leaders, arranged for their parole and transportation to the South. After a harrowing trip and a supposed delivery of information to President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders in Richmond, Virginia, they passed on to Savannah, Georgia and ultimately to the expected safety of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n\n\nWithin a few months, New Orleans was captured by Admiral David Farragut and General Benjamin Butler. Soon his wife, Eugenia, accused of failing to show proper respect to a soldier's passing funeral cortege, was arrested again and sent to a prison on Ship Island for three months. Upon her release in October 1862, again securing permission to leave Union-held territory, the family purchased a small house at La Grange, Georgia where they lived for the remainder of the war.\n\n\n\nAfter the war Phillips resumed his law practice, first in New Orleans and finally in 1867, after the Supreme Court voided the Test Oath of 1862, in Washington, D.C.. There he gradually became one of the leaders of the Bar, drawing most of his clients from the South. He generally practiced as a lawyer's lawyer, almost entirely before the U.S. Supreme Court, and appeared in over 400 cases.\n\n\n\nPhillips died January 14, 1884 in Washington, D.C. and is buried in Laurel Grove Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia. He achieved a solid reputation as a thoughtful moderate among the leading national figures of his day. Being a Southern Unionist, he had the opportunity, according to at least one biographer, to have had a career comparable to the career of U.S. President Andrew Johnson. This was complicated by his religion, and it was made impossible by the unrestrained activities of his wife.\n\nHUSBAND OF EUGENIA LEVY PHILLIPS, CONFEDERATE SPY; From Photographic Negative in Brady's National Portrait Gallery,; LONG & NOTED POLITICAL CAREER...; ;","thing_uuid":"{75E35767-B76F-4444-B900-CF0A4C42A21A}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04520","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04520","objects_customfield_5":"PHILLIPS, PHILIP","objects_objtype":"CDV","objects_date":"1/1/1860","objects_coltype":"PHOTOGRAPHY..Sitter","descript_1":"Carte-de-Visite of Phillip Phillips (1807-1884), an American lawyer and politician, who served as the representative from Alabama in the Democratic party and as secretary of the Reformed Society of Israelites","person_nam":"Phillips, Philip","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Phillips, Philip","location":"Mobile, AL","date":"1860-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"AL 7","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_al_7_1r.tif; doc_ja_al_7_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.205211,31.778701]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":642,"longitude":35.2052114,"latitude":31.77870133,"ref_1":"ref4032","ref_2":"cid4638033","genre":"Photographic images","genre_subl":"Photographs","descriptio":"The Pittsburg Times.

It was a playful Derso-&-Kelen cartoon of Baruch and fellow delegates to the Atomic Energy Commission, all dressed up like Dumas' jolly musketeers.\n\n\n\nThis is a photo of the cartoon signed by all five musketeers including Bernard Baruch. There may have only been four of these, one for each of the other musketeers. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs background_�_. In 1946 he was appointed the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) by President Harry S. Truman. On Friday, June 14, 1946, Baruch presented his Baruch Plan to the UNAEC, which proposed international control of then-new atomic energy.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the newly created UNAEC, Baruch suggested the elimination of nuclear weapons, an idea the Soviet Union rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\nA synopsis of his history:\n\n\n\nBernard Baruch was born in Camden, South Carolina to Simon and Belle Baruch. He was the second of four sons. His father Simon was a German Jewish immigrant who came to America in 1855. He became a surgeon on the staff of Confederate general Robert E. Lee during the American Civil War. His mother's Sephardic Jewish ancestors came to New York in the 1800, they were in the shipping business. In 1881 the family moved to New York City, and Bernard Baruch graduated from the City College of New York eight years later. \n\n\n\nHe eventually became a broker and then a partner in the firm of A. Housman and Company. With his earnings and commissions he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $18,000. There he amassed a fortune before the age of thirty via speculation in the sugar market. In 1903 he had his own brokerage firm and had gained the reputation of The Lone Wolf on Wall Street because of his refusal to join any other financial house. By 1910, he had become one of Wall Street's financial leaders.\n\n\n\nDuring World War I he advised President Woodrow Wilson on national defense, during which time he became the chairman of the War Industries Board. His stenographer was the unknown teenager Billy Rose. Baruch played a major role in turning American industry to full-scale war production. At the war's conclusion he was seen with President Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference. He never ran for elective office. \n\n\n\nUnder President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal Baruch was a member of the Brain Trust and helped form the NRA.\n\n\n\nDuring World War II he was a consultant on economic issues and proposed a number of measures including:\n\n\n\nA pay-as-you-go tax plan \n\n\n\nRent ceilings \n\n\n\nStockpiling of rubber and tin \n\n\n\nA synthetic rubber program to replace natural rubber, the sources of which were under enemy Axis Powers control \n\n\n\nBaruch argued that in modern war there was little room for free enterprise. He said Washington must control all aspects of the economy and that both business and unions must be subservient to the nation's security interest. Furthermore, price controls were essential to prevent inflation and to maximize military power per dollar. He wanted labor to be organized to facilitate optimum production. Baruch believed labor should be cajoled, coerced, and controlled as necessary: a central government agency would orchestrate the allocation of labor. He supported what was known as a work or fight bill. Baruch advocated the creation of a permanent superagency similar to his old Industries Board. Thus Baruch proposed to freeze economic freedom during war in order to preserve it for peace. Obviously his approach enhanced the role of civilian businessmen and industrialists in determining what was needed and who would produce it.[1] Baruch's ideas were largely adopted, with James Byrnes appointed to carry them out.\n\n\n\nBaruch was a high profile public figure, and did his best thinking in Washington D.C's Lafayette Park and in New York City's Central Park. It was not uncommon to see him discussing government affairs with other people while sitting on a park bench; this became his trademark. It was said that his office was a park bench near the White House.\n\n\n\nIn 1960, on his ninetieth birthday, a commemorative park bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House was dedicated to him. One would think after 55 years, he would stop to rest, but Baruch was not satisfied with staying put. He continued to advise on international affairs until his death on Sunday, June 20, 1965, in New York City, at the age of ninety-four.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{41E34520-9587-4907-AD03-6E523E782A1B}","objects_refno":"2009.02.27.00002","objects_customfield_6":"Google","objects_customfield_5":"Baruch, Bernard","objects_objtype":"PHOTOGRAPH","objects_date":"9/2/1946","objects_coltype":"PHOTOGRAPHY..Sitter","descript_1":"Photograph of a Derso-and-Kelen cartoon of Baruch and fellow delegates to the Atomic Energy Commission, all dressed up like Dumas' jolly musketeers, which was given to him on his 76th birthday.

He is famous for taking an ambrotype of then political hopeful Abraham Lincoln in 1857, it an often quoted story he lent young Lincoln his coat for the portrait. \n\n\n\nThe Lady Elgin was built in 1851 in Buffalo, New York, at a cost of $95,000. She was named after the wife of Lord Elgin, Canada's Governor General from 1847 to 1854.[5] During her time, the wooden-hulled sidewheeler was one of the most elegantly appointed passenger ships plying the Great Lakes. Rated a first-class steamer, she was a favorite with the traveling public. Early in her career she ran between Buffalo and Chicago, then later between Chicago and Collingwood, Ontario. For many of her later seasons, she plied the route between Chicago and other Lake Michigan ports and Lake Superior.[6]\n\nDuring the Lady Elgin's career she was involved in numerous accidents. She sank and was repaired in 1854 after striking a rock at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. In 1855, she was towed to Chicago after an accident to her machinery. In 1857, she was damaged by fire. In June 1858, she struck a reef at Copper Harbor, Michigan. In August 1858, she was stranded on Au Sable Point Reef in Lake Superior. In October 1859, she was towed to Marquette, Michigan after breaking her crossbeam. In November 1859, she was towed again when her crank pin broke near Point Iroquois, Michigan.[7] Her final blow came in 1860 when she was rammed by the wooden schooner Augusta ten miles from shore. In 1899, Great Lakes historian J.B. Mansfield called the Lady Elgin's sinking one of the greatest marine horrors on record.[6]\n\nOn the night of September 6, 1860 the Lady Elgin left Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from the Dooley, Martin, Dousman, and Company Dock, for Chicago, carrying members of Milwaukee's Union Guard to hear a campaign speech by Stephen A. Douglas, Abraham Lincoln's opponent, although there is no clear historical evidence that Douglas actually appeared. Three hundred men and women spent the day of September 7 listening to political speeches followed by an evening of entertainment by a German brass band on board the Lady Elgin.[5] On the return trip that night, the brightly lit Lady Elgin was steaming through Lake Michigan against gale force winds when she was rammed by the schooner Augusta of Oswego. The Augusta was sailing using only a single white light, mounted on a five foot Samson on the bow, and did not attempt, or was unable, to turn to avoid the collision in the gale.[8] On the morning of the collision (September 8) at 2:30 am, the Augusta rammed the port side of the Lady Elgin, damaging her own bowsprit and headgear, while holing the latter ship below the waterline.[8]\n\nConcerned that she was damaged and believing the Lady Elgin had gotten safely away, the Augusta made for Chicago. Aboard the Lady Elgin, Captain Wilson ordered that cattle and cargo be thrown overboard to lighten the load and raise the gaping hole in the Lady Elgin's port side above water level while the steward was down in the coal bunker trying to stop the leak with mattresses.[6][9] Captain Wilson ordered a lifeboat lowered on the starboard side to check the extent of the damage but it never regained the steamer. Within twenty minutes, the Lady Elgin broke apart, and all but the bow section rapidly sank. The night was lighted up at intervals by flashes of lightning showing the scattered wreckage.[6]\n\nThe life preservers, 2 in (5.1 cm) hardwood planks, 5 ft (1.5 m) long and 18 in (46 cm) wide, were never used.[5] Two boats with a total of 18 persons reached shore. In addition, fourteen people were saved on a large raft and many others on parts of the wreckage. Over 300 lives were lost and 98 saved.[6] The drummer of the German band, Charles Beverung, saved himself by using his large bass drum as a life preserver.[5] Survivors reported the heroic efforts of Captain Wilson to save about 300 persons collected on a raft.[6] When day broke, between 350 and 400 passengers and crew were drifting in stormy waters, holding on to anything they could, many only to be pulled under by breakers near shore.\n\nStudents from Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute were watching the shore on the morning of September 8, looking for survivors. One of the students, Edward Spencer, is credited with rescuing 17 passengers over the course of six hours. He sustained injuries during his rescue efforts that left him an invalid for the rest of his life. A plaque in his honor was first placed in the Northwestern University Gymnasium, and is now housed in the Northwestern University Library.[10][11]\n\nAbout 300 people died in the sinking,[2] including Captain Wilson, who was lost trying to save two women when he was caught by the surf and forced into the rocks.[10] Most were from Milwaukee with the majority of those from the Irish communities, including nearly all of Milwaukee's Irish Union Guard.[12] So many Irish-American political operatives died that day that the disaster has been credited with transferring the balance of political power in Milwaukee from the Irish to the Germans.[13] It is said that more than 1000 children were orphaned by the tragedy, however research shows that there were fewer than 40 children orphaned.[14][page needed] The Lady Elgin disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes.[3]\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{BC6A8B52-BEA0-4080-AD9D-9A855C1718B9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04431","objects_customfield_6":"Jewish-American History Foundation (Google)","objects_customfield_5":"ALSCHEULER, SAMUEL","objects_objtype":"PHOTOGRAPHER","objects_date":"1/1/1859","objects_coltype":"PHOTOGRAPHY..Photographer","descript_1":"Rare salt print photograph of the ship the Lady Elgin, which sank in 1860.

Located in today's Chinatown and Little Italy, Five Points played host to more riots, scams, prostitution, and drunkenness than any other neighborhood in America. But it was also crammed full of cheap theaters, dance halls, prizefighting venues, and political arenas that would one day dominate the national scene.

LEVY, WALSENBURG, COLORADO. \n\n\n\nThe card is light-weight stock, dark green on the front and gray on the back with rounded corners- measures 4 x 6.5. The bottom front has the photographer's credits stamped in gold: Bunker - Walsenburg, Colorado. There is a penciled inscription on the back (see below). Undated - late 1800's or early 20th century.\n\n\n\nThis interesting card shows a mule and colt in a paddock, and behind them, a man almost obscured by the mule but whose hat and legs are visible, as well as his eyes, just peering over the back of the mule. In the distance, a few out buildings and a house can be seen, and in the far distance open, flat land. The image is captioned: Mule and colt owned by A. Levy, Walsenburg, Colo. The back has an old penciled inscription stating: Claude and the mule with her colt. The colt is nursing, and the sun is casting strong shadows. \n\n\n\nWalsenburg is a small town where the killer of Jesse James, Robert Ford, once had a saloon. But a little research informed us that many German immigrants settled there.\n\n\n\nA check of the US census (of 1910) yielded information that makes it extremely likely that the A. Levy referred to here was either Alex Levy, who was born c. 1849 in Austria, immigrated to the US in 1866, and who was married to Lizzie, born in Germany - or possibly their oldest son, Archie Levy, born about 1873. (They also had sons, Walter, Ralph, and Earl.) \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nTHIS INFO WAS ON THE NET RE: GRAVESTONE RESEARCH!\n\n\n\nAlexander Levy was a devout Jew who helped form the first Minyan (quorum of ten men needed for some Jewish rituals) in southern Colorado Territory to celebrate Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur. He settled in Walsenburg and traveled forty miles each way through rough territory in order to join the Jewish community that met in the town of Trinidad and eventually helped found a chapter of B'nai B'rith there. He had become a successful dry goods merchant and store owner in Walsenburg by the time he married Lillie Louise Sporleder, whose religious affiliation is unknown. According to her descendants, however, she did not share Alexander's faith. Their first daughter, Sevilla was born on July 20, 1883 and died the same day. It is unclear what accommodation the couple may have made for their differing traditions when it came time to bury and memorialize their first child. Given the traditional male role in the Jewish household and Alexander's heavy involvement in the Jewish community at this time, however, at the very least he must have considered the grave marker compatible with his beliefs to have allowed it on his daughter's grave. More likely, it would have been he who ordered it.\n\n\n\nAlthough Alexander Levy often traveled to Denver, which had a thriving monument business and the highest concentration of Colorado Jews in the nineteenth century, the Levys ordered their daughter's monument from St. Louis monument maker and dealer Henry Marquardt. Levy and his brother-in-law, Walsenburg's founder Fred Walsen, partnered in Walsen & Levy General Merchandise at this time. A few years later, when the local paper referred to him as the great wholesale grocery man on South Main Street, Levy was in business for himself. A Democrat, he also was elected Huerfano County's treasurer and was a member of the Masonic Lodge. All of this suggests that he was a man of means and a force in the community. It explains why he and his wife might have been able to commission an artistically carved grave marker, but not why they chose the baby-in-a-half-shell.\n\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to infer that the Levys were unaware of, or unconcerned with, this monument's history in pagan and Christian sepulchral traditions. They are more likely to have made their choice based on the social status attached to a three-dimensional figurative white marble statue on their plot, or associations of the imagery with popular children's culture, or Jewish iconography. In relation to death and the spirit, the water associated with a symbolic seashell may allude to Jewish immersion as easily as to Christian baptism. In both Hebrew and Christian traditions, water is used to symbolize a spiritual cleansing indicative of a transformation. Nineteenth-century Jewish burial societies prepared the deceased with a purification ritual (Taharah) that involved prayerful washing of the corpse with a continuous stream of water. The cleansed body was then wrapped in a white shroud. The shroud-lined seashell in Sevilla's monument can be read as a reference to this pre-burial ceremony that assured the purity of the child's transition into the next state. It refers to spiritual purity in the same way that this quality was emphasized in the Christian iconography and embedded in Victorian American ideas about the nature of infancy\n\n","thing_uuid":"{257D443D-06AB-44F1-8ED9-FDDB675B93A5}","objects_refno":"2010.05.18.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.05.18.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Levy, Alexander","objects_objtype":"PHOTOGRAPH","objects_date":"1/1/1885","objects_coltype":"PHOTOGRAPHY..Sitter","descript_1":"Cabinet card of a mule and colt, owned by A.
