It is dated January 12, 1732 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It looks as if it is in Monis's hand. On the verso is the docket... Judah Monis's Recipt L .0.15.11, Jan'y 19, 1731/32....not in Monis's hand. Document is 3 x 5, overall excellent condition. Judah Monis (February 4, 1683 _�� April 25, 1764) was North America's first college instructor of the Hebrew language, teaching at Harvard College from 1722 to 1760, and authored the first Hebrew textbook published in North America. Monis was also the first Jew to receive a college degree in the American colonies.His conversion to Christianity made him a figure of some controversy to both Jews and Christians.\n\n\n\nHistory_�_Monis was born in Italy in 1683, into a family of formerly Portuguese converses. Educated at Jewish academies in Italy and Holland, Monis emigrated to New York City around 1715, where he established a small store and taught Hebrew to Christians and Jews. By 1720 he moved to Cambridge, Mass., home of Harvard College and an area in which few Jews resided.\n\n\n\nAt that time, all Harvard undergraduates except freshmen were required to study Hebrew. Harvard assumed that no Christian gentleman could be considered truly educated unless he could read the Bible in its original language. Encouraged by friends, Monis presented his personal, handwritten manual of Hebrew grammar to the Harvard Corporation in 1720, for its _��Judicious perusall._ѝ Two years later, the corporation _��Voted, That Mr. Judah Monis be approved instructor of the Hebrew Language,_ѝ making Monis Harvard's first full-time Hebrew instructor _�� but not as a Jew. For at that time, Harvard required its entire faculty to be professing Christians.\n\n\n\nFrom the time of his arrival in New York, Monis corresponded with leading Puritan clergy on Kabala, the trinity and Christian doctrine. Monis studied Christianity with Cambridge ministers. One month before assuming his post at Harvard, Monis converted to Christianity. His conversion attracted widespread notoriety. Some Christian clergy warned of other converted Jews who reverted to their original faith. They expressed concern that Harvard's requirement that its faculty members be Christians had compelled Monis to an insincere conversion. European Jews wrote of their outrage and dismay. Monis, however, defended his conversion in three books, published in 1722. He argued that he left Judaism out of religious conviction, not opportunism. \n\n\n\nMonis' instruction was based on the handwritten text he submitted to the Harvard Corporation in 1720. Each year, his new students had to copy the text by hand, a task that could take up to one month. A rare remaining handwritten copy of Monis' text resides in the archives of the American Jewish Historical Society. In 1724, to save his students from the burden of copying, Monis petitioned the corporation to publish his grammar. Eventually, the corporation agreed. Hebrew type was shipped from London, and in 1735, a thousand copies of Monis'_��A Grammar of the Hebrew Tongue!_ѝ were published _�� the first Hebrew textbook published in North America. \n\n\n\nHebrew was never a popular course at Harvard in Monis' time. Students complained that the exercises were boring, and college records show that Monis was frequently hazed by his students. While in 1723 the college recorded itself as _��greatly pleased with [Monis] assiduity and faithfulness to his instruction,_ѝ in 1724 the teaching of Hebrew to undergraduates was turned over to tutors. Monis remained responsible only for teaching graduate students and tutors. Monis taught at Harvard until 1760. By then, his responsibilities had dwindled to one weekly class with graduate students. His own health declining and student interest flagging, he retired. Monis died in 1764 and is buried in a churchyard in Northboro, Mass.\n\n\n\nThe Christian community sometimes looked on him with skepticism. The Cambridge First Church and the Harvard College records often refer to Monis as _��the converted Jew,_ѝ _��the converted rabbi;_ѝ and _��the Christianized Jew._ѝ Church records indicate concern that Monis may have quietly continued to observe the Sabbath on Saturday. The headstone of his grave in the Northboro churchyard bears witness to the double identity by which Monis lived in Massachusetts. Using the Christian image of a grafted tree for conversion, the inscription reads in part: _��A native branch of Jacob see. Which once from off its olive brook/ Regrafted, from the living tree._ѝ \n\n","thing_uuid":"{23C7C63B-AAED-4E04-B4CE-5781B0103F46}","objects_refno":"2011.04.17.00002","objects_customfield_6":"2011.04.17.00002","objects_customfield_5":"Monis, Judah (1683-1764)","objects_objtype":"Receipt","objects_date":"1/12/1732","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Monis, Judah","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Monis, Judah","location":"Cambridge, MA","date":"1732-01-12T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"MA 263","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ma_263_1r.tif; doc_ja_ma_263_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.456887,39.161997]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":396,"longitude":-84.45688654,"latitude":39.16199715,"ref_1":"ref210","ref_2":"cid4641829","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"American Israelite.

In 1832, Ahlenfeld received his degree to begin the practice of surgery. Ahlenfeld left Germany for the United States where he hoped to earn a 'fortune' practicing. He had arrived in Baltimore by mid-1833 and continued his medical study at the University of Maryland. Having passed examinations for the medical faculty of that university, Ahlenfeld was granted an MD by the Board of Trustees in 1835. His thesis was De Morbis Venereis (Venereal diseases). He became a citizen of the US in 1845. Thereafter, Ahlenfeld maintained a medical practice in Maryland and northern Virginia until his death in c.1854.\n\n\n\nHis papers are in the William L. Clements Library at The University of Virginia. This collection consists mainly of correspondence written to or for Ahlenfeld. includes a large number of letters of recommendation written by friends and professional acquaintances in Germany and the United States, a few letters from patients (or the families of patients), and a few letters dealing with personal or non-medical business affairs; including testimonials for a case brought against Ahlenfeld in Gettysburg (Pa.), in which he was accused of appearing in that town several years previously under an assumed identity. The collection also includes some notes made in medical school, several lengthy manuscripts in German and Hebrew on medicine; and approximately 12 letters in Hebrew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCLC 29891507 [1- Lib.

Its members were raised in the counties of Campbell, Botetourt, Montgomery, Fauquier, Culpeper, and Rockbridge. The unit fought at First Manassas under General Longstreet and at Dranesville under J.E.B. Stuart. Later it was assigned to General A.P. Hill's, Kemper's, and W.R. Terry's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. It served with the army from Williamsburg to Gettysburg except when it was at Suffolk with Longstreet. The 11th was engaged at Plymouth in North Carolina and after returning to Virginia saw action at Drewry's Bluff and Cold Harbor. It went on to fight in the Petersburg trenches south and north of the James River and ended the war at Appomattox. This regiment reported 6 killed and 15 wounded at Dranesville, totalled 750 men in April, 1862, and lost 134 at Williamsburg and 100 at Frayser's Farm.

Hays fully in his hand. It was written in New York City on 12/4/1766 and relates to business. It has rare post marks and Western Frontier reference. This is a rare letter from early in his business career.\n\n\n\nMoses Michael Hays was born in New York City in 1739 to Dutch immigrants Judah Hays and Rebecca Michaels Hays. Judah Hays took his son into his shipping and retail business and, upon his death in 1764, left him the business and largest share of his assets. In 1766, Moses married Rachel Myers, younger sister of famed New York silversmith Myer Myers. Moses served New York's Congregation Shearith Israel as second parnas (vice-president) in 1766 and parnas in 1767.\n\n\n\nIn 1769, the couple moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where Hays continued his shipping business. Business reverses landed Hays in debtor's prison but, under a 1771 reform law, Hays liquidated his assets, gave them to his creditors and was set free. He immediately reestablished himself in the trans-Atlantic trade.\n\n\n\nThe American Revolution brought Hays a new challenge as a Jew. In 1775, seventy-six men in Newport were asked to sign a declaration of loyalty to the American colonies that included the phrase, upon the true faith of a Christian. Hays publicly objected to the phrase and refused to sign, instead offering a letter affirming his belief that the Revolution was a just cause. When, after much wrangling, the Christian portion of the oath was omitted, Hays affixed his name.\n\n\n\nHays and his family left Newport for Boston ahead of the British occupation in 1776. Hays opened a shipping office in Boston and was among the first merchants there to underwrite shipbuilding, trade and insurance to newly opened Far Eastern markets. In 1784, Hays became a founder and the first depositor of the Massachusetts Bank, still doing business today as Fleet Bank Corporation. With his close friend Paul Revere and fourteen other Boston businessmen, Hays formed several insurance companies. Hays helped establish the New England Masonic movement. When Hays was accepted into the Massachusetts Lodge in November 1782, he was the only Jew, the first signal that Hays had won acceptance in Boston's elite society. In 1792, the lodge members elected Hays their Grand Master. Paul Revere served as his Deputy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Boston lacked a synagogue, Moses Michael Hays conducted regular worship services at home. The household library contained dozens of Hebrew books. The Jewish commandment to dispense charity directed much of what the Hays family did for Boston and its citizens. Moses Michael Hays provided financial support to beautify Boston Common, establish theaters and endow Harvard College. His children and nephews went on to distinguished and charitable lives. Son Judah Hays was the first professing Jew elected to Boston public office. Hays descendants helped found the Boston Athenaeum and the Massachusetts General Hospital. Nephews Judah and Abraham Touro learned to be successful merchants from their uncle and Judah went on to become America's first great national philanthropist.\n\n\n\nMoses Michael Hays died in 1805. His obituaries in the secular press remembered him as a most valuable citizen . . . now secure in the bosom of his Father and our Father, of his God and our God. Hays lived his life successfully as an American and a Jew, accepted by the Boston community with respect as both. \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{D0449CFE-89BD-434D-A87B-BF4C2152FBCF}","objects_refno":"2011.01.24.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2011.01.24.00001","objects_customfield_5":"HAYS, MOSES MICHAEL (1739.1805)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"12/4/1766","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Signed Colonial-era letter by Moses M.

This port of entry document is fromHendricks & Brothers. shipping finished copper to Hartford, Connecticut\n\n\n\n3 of 5\n\n\n\nThe Hendricks family of New York helped lay the foundation for the Industrial Revolution in America. Their pioneering production of copper was vital to the growth of the American economy and the nation's military might. When the company closed in 1938, Hendricks Brothers was the oldest continuous privately held Jewish family business in the United States.\n\n\n\nUriah Hendricks, the patriarch of the family, was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1737 and emigrated from London to New York City in 1755. In New York, he opened a dry goods store and became an active member, and eventually parnas, or president, of Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. The congregation served as the unifying institution of the New York Jewish community, which numbered about 200 people. In 1764, Hendricks established a metals business, importing copper and brass from England, which discouraged manufacture of these commodities in the American colonies. On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928. Hendricks Brothers closed its last copper mill in 1938.\n\n\n\nJust as Harmon Hendricks was able to build a business that his descendants maintained, he was able to continue a tradition of religious commitment that his father, Uriah, had bequeathed to him. Each of Harmon's children found a spouse among the families at Shearith Israel. Son Henry joined his father-in-law, Tobias I. Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz. In 1852, Henry Hendricks and eight others founded Jews' Hospital, now Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, the oldest Jewish medical institution in the United States.\n\n\n\nIsaac Leeser, editor of The Occident, the leading American Jewish newspaper of the pre-Civil War era, was often critical of what he considered the aloof and uncharitable attitudes of the Sephardic grandees. To quote Maxwell Whiteman, however, Leeser singled out the liberality of the Hendricks family as an exception ��_ Modesty and reserve continued to govern the family attitude in matters of philanthropy, and the practice of keeping such activity from the public eye, begun by Harmon Hendricks, was maintained by his descendants.\n\n\n\nIn the same low-key and generous manner, the Hendricks family descendants continue to be active in Shearith Israel and in Jewish communal life today.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{B3855C89-FC8C-4D29-A69A-481C32D3F65B}","objects_refno":"2008.08.25.00025","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.25.00025","objects_customfield_5":"Hendricks & Brothers","objects_objtype":"PORT OF ENTRY","objects_date":"7/10/1845","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Port of entry document from Hendricks and Brothers, shipping finished copper to Hartford, Connecticut","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Hendricks and Brothers","merger":"Hendricks and Brothers","location":"New York, NY","date":"1845-07-10T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 864","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_864_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_864_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1477,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref3712","ref_2":"cid4638349","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Post cards","descriptio":"HESTER STREET...USED; COLOR....GOOD MARKET SCENE; ; ;","thing_uuid":"{7126CBED-5B8C-4D84-9FDE-CD17BBFF831C}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04400","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04400","objects_customfield_5":"NONE","objects_objtype":"POSTCARDS","objects_date":"1/1/2008","objects_coltype":"PHOTOGRAPHY..Location","descript_1":"A postcard of Hester Street with a market scene","person_nam":"Jacobson, Miss L.","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Jacobson, Miss L.","location":"New York, NY","date":"1908-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Box","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"4","containe_2":"Object","containe_3":"1j","tiff_locat":"bx4_1j_1r.tif; bx4_1j_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.407897,41.117596]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1699,"longitude":-73.4078965,"latitude":41.11759561,"ref_1":"ref3485","ref_2":"cid4638574","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Official documents","descriptio":"Adams, Daniel.

In this stampless cover letter he is answering  Morais' request for $300 for the poor , Hart refers him to the enclosed broadside resolution of the Board of Mikveh Israel granting the request.    This is interesting documentation of interface between requesting a charity, the rabbi and the Board.\n\n\n\nIn 1845 he went to London to apply for the vacant post of assistant hazzan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city. (The position of Hazzan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.\n\n\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia, became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. \n\n\n\nIn 1855 he married Clara Esther Weil, who died in 1872, leaving seven children. From the date of his installation as hazzan until his death his influence was a continually growing power for conservative Judaism. The synagogue formerly (c.1906) occupied by the Mikveh Israel congregation was built and consecrated during his incumbency.\n\n\n\nThough his ministry covered the period of greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity.\n\n\n\nHis sermons covered a wide scope of thought and action, and he showed the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil War, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show his warm sympathy with the cause of the slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members.\n\n\n\nWhen, in 1867, Maimonides College was established in Philadelphia, Morais was made professor of the Bible and of Biblical literature, and he held the chair during the six years that the college existed. For a number of years thereafter he felt the urgent need of an institution for the training of Jewish ministers on historical and traditional lines, and the declarations of the Pittsburg Conference in 1885 urged him to immediate action. After a considerable agitation of the subject he succeeded, in conjunction with a few others, in establishing (January, 1886) the Jewish Theological Seminary at New York.\n\n\n\nHe was at once made president of the faculty and professor of Bible, holding both posts until his death. Unquestionably the establishment of the seminary constitutes Morais' most lasting influence upon Judaism in America. The directors of that body have fittingly recognized his memory by naming the chair of Biblical literature and exegesis the Sabato Morais professorship. In 1887 the University of Pennsylvania conferred upon him the honorary degree of doctor of laws, he being the first Jew so honored by that institution. Many of his papers are evidently held in that institution's library.\n\n\n\nIn all his life, Morais maintained close (cultural, religious and political) ties with his motherland, Italy. His translations and essays in Italian Jewry made him the founding father of Italian Jewish Studies in America.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{05C47A5E-FE65-4D13-92E5-C830A6878729}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03690","objects_customfield_6":"SINGERMAN not listed","objects_customfield_5":"HART, ABRAHAM / MORAIS,SABATO RABBI (1823.1897)","objects_objtype":"LETTER    & Broaside","objects_date":"9/18/1855","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Broadside and letter from Abraham Hart, the Parnis of Mikveh Israel Synagogue to Rabbi Sabato Morais (1823-1897) of Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

It is odd that there is this 17 year lapse in the numerous letters that the collection holds. It is clear that he was welcome senior advisor to Leeser in his early days in America. As a note Leeser came to America in 1824.\n\n\n\nThere is scant information on David Judah although The Hebrews in America by Isaac Markens lists him as a leading member of the Richmond Synagogue and a merchant. He is not listed in Malcolm Stern's genealogy, however it is noted that Rachel Judah (1772 NYC- 1863 NYC) was married to Isaac Leeser's uncle..Zalma Rehine (in 1800) of Richmond where he ran a dry-goods business. Possibly this all leads to a family connection. All information on David Judah of Richmond stops in the early 1830's therefore pointing to his move to Baltimore about that time.

Teller  with their printed letterhead Sept. 13, 1889 to noted Jewish scholar Cyrus Adler. The first part is historical research as to application of Blue laws in Pennsylvania re: Jews He writes that after research was able to find but one case (in 1817) where:  ��_a Jew was charged with having performed work on Sunday��_[and] convicted��_on appeal to Supreme Court his attorney reasoned why he should not have been arrested [describing reasons at length]��_but yet the Jew was convicted on appeal, as well. Letter concludes:  possible there are other statutes and decisions relating to the Jews, but have not yet found them��_  \n\nThe second part deals with important Jewish matters in Europe��_Writes of the many changes he noted in Turkey since his last visit and ��_Have successfully settled five issues and [close] to settling other matters, but will not count the chicken until eggs are hatched.  ��_Regarding the indemnity, [almost] a lost cause for all nations, I developed a new plan [by which] both England and Italy are guided by me.  ��_ the ambassador asked for and received from their gov'ts, France has already come in��_British Ambassador has instructions to follow and assists me��_our claims the same as theirs��_Having settled two affairs I TOOK UP THE JEWISH QUESTION, which I neglected until then��_so our gov't could answer questions coming to [them].

I saw her in Vienna��_. I fear her days are few; a noble woman and the greatest in ability and heart I have ever known. \n\n\n\nOscar B. Teller's biographic sketch is a full page in The Jews of Philadelphia by Morias ( 1894). He was ranked as running the most important real-estate investment firm in Philadelphia. At times he was a partner with Mayer Sulzberger.  Teller was active in numerous local and international Jewish institutions as the letter clearly demonstrates. His work for Jews abroad pre-dated by almost two decades the founding of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) in 1906 who's the aim is rallying all sections of American Jewry to defend the rights of Jews all over the world. As noted below Dr. Cyrus Adler was the founder of the American Jewish Committee.\n\nDr. Cyrus Adler was born in Van Buren, Arkansas, a graduate of University of Pennsylvania in 1883 and gained a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1887, where he taught Semitic languages from 1884 to 1893. He was for a number of year's librarian and then secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was the founder of the American Jewish Historical Society, was one of the editors of the Jewish Encyclopedia, and edited the American-Jewish Year-Book after 1899. He was president of Dropsie College from 1908 to 1940 and of the Jewish Theological Seminary after 1924. He was a founder of the American Jewish Committee and of the Jewish Welfare Board. At the end of World War I, he participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He was president of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning 1908 to 1940 and Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America In addition; he was a founding member of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nAdler was a bachelor much of his life, marrying Racie Friedenwald of Baltimore in 1905, when he was 42. They had one child, a daughter Sarah. He died in Philadelphia, and his papers are held by the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{C11C0B77-FA20-4440-8BA5-A3CADCA81852}","objects_refno":"2009.04.15.00011","objects_customfield_6":"2009.04.15.00011","objects_customfield_5":"Teller, Oscar  B. /  Adler, Cyrus","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"11/23/1898","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from Oscar Teller to Cyrus Adler regarding Blue Laws in Pennsylvania","person_nam":"Teller, Oscar B.","person_n_1":"Adler, Cyrus","corporatio":"","merger":"Adler, Cyrus | Teller, Oscar B.","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1898-11-23T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHIL 285","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_285_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_285_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_285_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_285_2v.tif; doc_ja_phil_285_3r.tif; doc_ja_phil_285_3v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2031,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref3046","ref_2":"cid4639008","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Tobias, Henry.

Mordecai Sheftell and Chaim Salomon were witnesses to his marriage to Esther Mordecai, widow of Moses. She was a convert. An active Jew, he was a founding member of Beth Shalome in Richmond and President of M-I (1810-11) in Philadelphia.

My fathers information is that which he heard from persons who had lived in those times; he was too young to know anything personally of the Revolution.  ��_Mr. Cardozo was the old gentleman who lived for many years after in Charleston.  He has a son there who may know something [and more about Cardozo and relatives who might be of help] Cardozo I think was 1'st sgt of the Company; died some years ago quite aged.  I agree with you on the importance [of not concealing such information] particularly so far as service rendered by our people in communities where they have located.  ��_[As our people] were a scattered nation, we are divested of the pride and sympathy of nationality here and elsewhere.  ��_The only difficulty I see occurs in having active duties to the state may carry us without conflict without our peculiar views.  For my own part I have rather avoided posts of honor or profit because I felt I could not attend to them without violating my Sabbath.  For instance in a legislative body one could scarcely be absent on the Sabbath without incurring jeopardy to the rights and interests of a constituency; a crisis both in peace and war might occur [and offers reason why duty might overcome the need to observe Sabbath etc., referring to Pres. Jefferson's thoughts and earlier experiences on the subject.  Also discusses recent festivals believe it was likely Passover] and they��_made preparations by house-cleaning, etc. and we procured our bread [likely Matzoh] from New York.

Between 1829 and 1835, he visited England, Russia, Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt, in addition to the majority of countries in Central and Western Europe. He became the first American to tour the Nile Valley.  Upon his return to the states, Cohen served as a Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly in 1847, was a delegate to the State Peace Convention during the Civil War, and acted as Vice President of the Baltimore Committee of the Alliance Israelite Universelle.

See letter from his sister Hannah written from Texas in 1855 to Leeser. Dyer had an adventurous life while maintaining close ties to his religion (see bio below)\n\n\n\nMajor Leon Dyer was born on 2 Oct 1807 in Mayene, Germany and was the son of John Maximilian and Babette (Nachmann) Dyer. Leon's birth name was Feist Emanuel Heim/Haim. Leon's siblings: Rosanna Dyer Osterman (Mrs. Joseph) , Isadore Dyer , Hannah Dyer Symonds (Mrs. Henry D.) , Joseph Dyer, Barney Dyer and Abraham Dyer . In about 1812, the family immigrated to the United States and first settled in Baltimore, MD and began a meat packing business. Dyer and his father were very active in the Jewish community. He was in the leadership of a group that started and built Baltimore's first synagogue. He later became president of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation. Dyer always worked closely with his father in fulfilling their religious responsibilities and duties. The two helped organize and start the United Hebrew Society of Baltimore.\n\n \n\nDyer participated in the Second Seminole War and was with General Winfield Scott in Florida when they engaged the Seminole Indians, who had massacred 110 U.S. Army soldiers in December 1835. On 28 February 1836 in New Orleans, LA, Dyer was appointed a the Regimental Quartermaster of the Regiment of Louisiana Volunteers by the Governor of Louisiana, Edward D. White, Sr. \n\n\n\nIn April 1836, Dyer met General Thomas Jefferson Green in New Orleans, LA and joined the Texas War of Independence. With a company of 29 men command by Captain William Graham from New Orleans, Dyer embarked on the Schooner Sarah Carter, bound for Galveston, arriving on 20 April 1836, two days after the Battle of San Jacinto. On 18 May 1836, he received a commission as Major in the Texas forces, signed by the President David G. Burnett, the first President of the Republic of Texas. He was appointed as an aid-de-camp to General Green. The Louisiana contingent was assigned to the force of General Green, and saw active service clearing western Texas of bands of plundering Mexican troops. In January 1837, Dyer was assigned the task of escorting General Santa Anna to Washington, DC. It was during this trip that Dyer approached other family members about coming to Texas. \n\n \n\n\n\nDyer returned to Baltimore in 1840, he devoted himself to business and his religious duties. He was very active in the building of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on the corner of Lloyd and Walter Streets.. In 1852, President Millard Fillmore enlisted Dyer to deliver confidential dispatches to the Prussian government in Berlin. Dyer was commended for this mission. In ca. 1852, probably in Germany, Leon married his first cousin, Sarah Nachman, who was the daughter of his mother's twin brother, Joseph Nachman. Major Leon Dyer died of dysentery on 14 September 1883 in Louisville, Jefferson Co., KY. His body was shipped to Galveston, Galveston Co., TX for burial. The funeral was conducted at 4 p.m. on 9 October 1883 from the home of his brother, Isadore. Burial was in the Hebrew Benevolent Society Cemetery. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{08A1414E-BA4A-408D-A0A7-73E1299EEED4}","objects_refno":"2010.09.21.00004","objects_customfield_6":"2010.09.21.00004","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / Dyer, Leon Colonel","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"1/31/1848","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Personal letter from Colonel Leon Dyer in Baltimore, Maryland to Isaac Leeser.

In this letter to the 23 yr old Isaac Leeser he gives his reservations on the draft of his first book Instructions in the Mosaic Religion. and incorporates strong suggestions. The book was printed in 1830. (See 20.334 for a letter on the same subject;).\n\n\n\nThe strength of Judah's observations are captured in this paragraph from the letter_�_ believe me your reputation will sink or swim by its success.

It is odd that there is this 17 year lapse in the numerous letters that the collection holds. It is clear that he was welcome senior advisor to Leeser in his early days in America. As a note Leeser came to America in 1824.\n\n\n\nThere is scant information on David Judah although The Hebrews in America by Isaac Markens lists him as a leading member of the Richmond Synagogue and a merchant. He is not listed in Malcolm Stern's genealogy, however it is noted that Rachel Judah (1772 NYC- 1863 NYC) was married to Isaac Leeser's Uncle..Zalma Rehine (in 1800) of Richmond where he ran a dry-goods business. Possibly this all leads to a family connection. All information on David Judah of Richmond stops in the early 1830's therefore pointing to his move to Baltimore about that time.

Cohen also played a prominent role in the social life of Baltimore and was reputed to have been a violinist, a botanist, and a horticulturist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{68E1804B-AA7E-42D0-8794-7509A2F9C1C5}","objects_refno":"2008.08.23.00002","objects_customfield_6":"AN AMER.

Hays��_ASD��_Boston��_4/25/1799...Good early Content\n\n\n\nMoses Michael Hays was born in New York City in 1739 to Dutch immigrants Judah Hays and Rebecca Michaels Hays. Judah Hays took his son into his shipping and retail business and, upon his death in 1764, left him the business and largest share of his assets. In 1766, Moses married Rachel Myers, younger sister of famed New York silversmith Myer Myers. Moses served New York's Congregation Shearith Israel as second parnas (vice-president) in 1766 and parnas in 1767.\n\n\n\nIn 1769, the couple moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where Hays continued his shipping business. Business reverses landed Hays in debtor's prison but, under a 1771 reform law, Hays liquidated his assets, gave them to his creditors and was set free. He immediately reestablished himself in the trans-Atlantic trade.\n\n\n\nThe American Revolution brought Hays a new challenge as a Jew. In 1775, seventy-six men in Newport were asked to sign a declaration of loyalty to the American colonies that included the phrase, upon the true faith of a Christian. Hays publicly objected to the phrase and refused to sign, instead offering a letter affirming his belief that the Revolution was a just cause. When, after much wrangling, the Christian portion of the oath was omitted, Hays affixed his name.\n\n\n\nHays and his family left Newport for Boston ahead of the British occupation in 1776. Hays opened a shipping office in Boston and was among the first merchants there to underwrite shipbuilding, trade and insurance to newly opened Far Eastern markets. In 1784, Hays became a founder and the first depositor of the Massachusetts Bank, still doing business today as Fleet Bank Corporation. With his close friend Paul Revere and fourteen other Boston businessmen, Hays formed several insurance companies. Hays helped establish the New England Masonic movement. When Hays was accepted into the Massachusetts Lodge in November 1782, he was the only Jew, the first signal that Hays had won acceptance in Boston's elite society. In 1792, the lodge members elected Hays their Grand Master. Paul Revere served as his Deputy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Boston lacked a synagogue, Moses Michael Hays conducted regular worship services at home. The household library contained dozens of Hebrew books. The Jewish commandment to dispense charity directed much of what the Hays family did for Boston and its citizens. Moses Michael Hays provided financial support to beautify Boston Common, establish theaters and endow Harvard College. His children and nephews went on to distinguished and charitable lives. Son Judah Hays was the first professing Jew elected to Boston public office. Hays descendants helped found the Boston Athenaeum and the Massachusetts General Hospital. Nephews Judah and Abraham Touro learned to be successful merchants from their uncle and Judah went on to become America's first great national philanthropist.\n\n\n\nMoses Michael Hays died in 1805. His obituaries in the secular press remembered him as a most valuable citizen . . . now secure in the bosom of his Father and our Father, of his God and our God. Hays lived his life successfully as an American and a Jew, accepted by the Boston community with respect as both. \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1BB45D46-E2AF-483C-AF71-D33613A58C51}","objects_refno":"2011.02.18.00005","objects_customfield_6":"2011.02.18.00005","objects_customfield_5":"HAYS, MOSES MICHAEL (1739.1805)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"4/25/1799","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Signed business letter from Moses Michael Hays in Boston, MA","person_nam":"Hays, Moses Michael","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Hays, Moses Michael","location":"New York, NY","date":"1799-04-25T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"MA 256","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ma_256_1r.tif; doc_ja_ma_256_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.456887,39.161997]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":414,"longitude":-84.45688654,"latitude":39.16199715,"ref_1":"ref2400","ref_2":"cid4639653","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Letter (Judaica) - A signed letter by Joseph Jonas (9/7/1840) inviting Allan G.

Simons & Henry (partnership of William Henry and Joseph Simon in Lancaster, Pennsylvania). This partnership manufactured and supplied guns to the Revolution.  It is signed by Moses Henry (Moses Henry is listed as a gunsmith_�_owned land in Pittsburgh in1768_�_ and the brother of William Henry) at Schenectady, dated 19 August, 1774, to pay Mr. Robert C. Clench at sight Eighteen Pounds Pennsylvania Currency. ...Verso endorsed by  Levy Andrew Levy at Lancaster, 19 October, 1774, ordering Michael and Barnard Gratz pay the contents of the within. The document is a vivid example of interlocking business relationships between the early Pennsylvania Jewish communities.\n\n\n\nJoseph Simon was one of the most prominent Indian traders and merchants and one of the largest landholders in America, his enterprises extending not only over Pennsylvania, but to Ohio and Illinois and to the Mississippi river. Levy Andrew Levy was among the twenty-two residents of Lancaster, to whom various Indian tribes in Illinois conveyed a tract of land comprising the southern half of the present state of Illinois, includes the following names of Jews: Moses, Jacob, and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Moses Franks, Jr. and Joseph Simon.\n\n\n\nLevy Andrew Levy (1734-1829...Baltimore) was a trader located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Born in London, his mother was the sister of Joseph Simon of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was first listed in Lancaster in 1753.\n\n\n\nIn 1760 Levy Andrew Levy founded a trading house in Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). He was a partner of his uncle, Joseph Simon in his Lancaster, Pennsylvania store. Simon was one of the most prominent Indian traders and merchants and one of the largest landholders in America, his enterprises extending not only over Pennsylvania, but to Ohio and Illinois and to the Mississippi river. Levy Andrew Levy was among the twenty-two residents of Lancaster, to whom various Indian tribes in Illinois conveyed a tract of land comprising the southern half of the present state of Illinois, includes the following names of Jews: Moses, Jacob, and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Moses Franks, Jr. and Joseph Simon.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Gratz (1740-1811) was Parnas of Mikveh Israel from 1784 to 1785.. He arrived from Germany in 1758, following his older brother, Bernard, who was previously apprenticed to David Franks. Together they set up a coastal shipping service between New Orleans and Quebec. The French & Indian Wars interfered with shipping, and drove the brothers to western frontier trade in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky. They, along with David Franks, Mathias Bush and others, signed the Non-Importation Resolutions of 1765 to protest the Stamp Act. Later, the Gratz brothers supplied the Continental Army. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, the firm relocated to Lancaster, home of the father-in-law of Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon.\n\n\n\nMichael and Miriam Gratz were the parents of twelve children. Among their children is Rebecca Gratz (1781-1869) who achieved renown as founder and officer of social and educational institutions managed by women. These organizations served as a model for others. They are the source of schools and social agencies in existence today.\n\n\n\nBernard Gratz (1738-1801) immigrated to America from Poland -- via England -- in 1754. Bernard apprenticed to David Franks. His younger brother Michael (1740-1811) arrived from Germany in 1758. They set up a coastal shipping service between New Orleans and Quebec. The French & Indian Wars interfered with shipping, and drove the brothers to western frontier trade in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky. They, along with David Franks, Mathias Bush and others, signed the Non-Importation Resolutions of 1765 to protest the Stamp Act. Later, the Gratz brothers supplied the Continental Army. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, the firm relocated to Lancaster, home of the father-in-law of Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon. The brother helped found one of the first synagogues in America, which in 1773 evolved into Philadelphia's Congregation Mikvah Israel. After the War, the Gratz's became involved in a successful struggle for equal rights in Pennsylvania.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{F8D4E49C-7B82-4953-8329-A1286FCAA08B}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03830","objects_customfield_6":"THE JEWS OF LANCASTER, PA.

It is Leeser's translation from the original letter (in the German language) he earlier received (from New York dated 9/13/1849 ) by Rabbi Joseph Schwarz, a German born and trained rabbi.\n\n\n\nDocuments from Rabbi Joseph Schwarz are important and sought after, a two page letter written to Leeser in Judeo-German in cursive Aschkenazic script relating to the delayed printing of his book Descriptive Geography and Historical Sketch of Palestine , along with a copy of the book (Rosenbach lists four copies) sold for $68,880 at the Kestenbaum Auction lot 275, 5/27/2010.\n\n\n\nRabbi Joseph Schwarz was visiting his brother in New York at the time he wrote his letter to Leeser. He devoted himself to the history  and geography of the Holy Land, where he spent most of his life; the results of his studies into the history, geography, geology of that country place him among the leading Palestinian explorers and geographers and the greatest Jewish authority (since the 14th century) on Palestinian matters at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first formal attempt to broadly solicit an annual pledge from synagogues rather than individuals for needs in Palestine. This concept would eventually morph into omnibus Charities such as United Jewish Appeal. Arthur Kiron, Curator of Judaica Collections at the Penn Library, believes that this document is an historical marker in the evolution of American Jewish philanthropy and may well be one of the most important documents in the Collection. It is an icon of the evolution of transoceanic Jewery...first in commerce, religious practice and then in philanthropic needs..\n\n The document starts out TO THE FRIENDS OF THE ISRAELITES OF PALESTINE. It is written as a general appeal for funds for Jewish in Palestine. This was clearly to be issued as a broadside with a certificate _�_ In Leeser's hand is his notation to his printer in the upper blank margin at top of the first page:  make with this/ and the certificates about/ three pages, and print/ 200 copies, or 8 quires/ on letter sheet/ new [?]. It is unlisted in Rosenbach, possibly the broadside was never printed. This translation by Leeser is the only record of this early broad appeal to all American Synagogues from this well known historian. One year later Leeser translated and published Schwarz's masterwork Descriptive Geography and Historical Sketch of Palestine. \n\n\n\n\n\nRabbi Joseph Schwarz was visiting his brother in New York at the time he wrote his letter to Leeser.

It opens:   Knowing that the descendants of Israel have not relinquished/ the ancient character of benevolence for which they have been/ always distinguished the undersigned messengers from the Holy/ Land, beg [?] to lay before you the following statement,/ in the full hope that it may incite you to aid the small rem/nant yet residing in the country over which once ruled chiefs/ and princes governing in the spirit of our religion, and when/ spoke the ports and prophets of our own race in a language/ never to be forgotten.  It was owing to our transgressions that/ we as a nation were banished from that land, where formerly/ [crossed-out: there] reigned plenty and elegance, but where now all in desolation/ and ruin.\n\n\n\nIt ends with the appeal for funds_�_. It has accordingly been the practice of European Jews to/ aid their brothers in Palestine with annual donations, to collect/ which messengers were sent out to bring the funds to the managers/ in the chief cities just named.  But the expenses attending this/ mode are evidently very great, and to obviate this, the undersigned/ accredited messengers from Jerusalem have been instructed to appeal/ to all congregations in America to organize a permanent relief/ fund, to consist of free will offerings, annual collections and stated/ contributions, which are to be forwarded to such persons as the/ Israelites of this country may themselves designate, and distri-/buted in good faith and impartially among all who stand in/ need of assistance.  The subjoined certificates will at once show that/ a number of influential persons in this country have already offered/ their services; and we hope that you will induce your congregation or/ immediate friends to be active in the cause, and to send out through/ a committee in your own neighborhood or the various gentlemen/ here named in New York and Philadelphia any fund you may collect./  The Portuguese congregation in New York have already appropriated $25/ per annum; other bodies in that place have followed with similar donations/ and all this independently of the Hebra [Hebrew] whose object it is to/ aid the poor of the Holy Land.  In case our appeal is responded to,/ we can assure our brethren in America that the congregations/ in Palestine will not send out any more [crossed-out: any] special/ messengers, wherefore [crossed-out: they] you will not hereafter be troubled by [crossed-out: any]/ personal applicants.  Due notice will be given as soon as possible/ of the distributing commission to be appointed in Palestine, and we/ can give the most positive assurance that the wishes of the donor shall/ be faithfully carried into effect_�_ Letter terminates: Invoking the blessing of God on you all [and] ourselves_�_your brothers_�_Rabbi Joseph Schwarz / Rabbi Zadok Levy_�_messengers from Jerusalem.

Henry Cohen married Mathilda Samuel (of the prominent Samuel family of Liverpool) in 1844. The Cohen family maintained close relations with important London Jewish families, including the Aguilars. Both he and Mathilda were leaders in the Philadelphia Jewish community. In a biographical sketch she is described as a Lady of culture; brilliant conversationalist....executive ability and a dignified presence; friendship of a select civic circle; obtained distinction beyond the Jewish Community during the Civil War she was the Delegate to the women's Branch of the Sanitary Commission and a member of their famous Fair. As part of her various civic projects, Mathilda Cohen founded the Committee of Thirteen, which organized the art exhibit at Philadelphia's 1876 centennial celebration. She exerted great efforts on behalf of numerous Jewish Charities.\n\n\n\n Charles and Mary had one younger sister named Katherine who also attained prominence, as an artist and sculptress. She studied art in Philadelphia, New York, Paris and Italy, and was renowned for her many artistic productions, including the busts of several famous individuals, such as Judge Mayer Sulzberger and Lucien Moss.\n\n\n\nCharles Joseph Cohen was born on September 21, 1847 in Philadelphia into a prosperous family and died in Atlantic City, New Jersey, September 17, 1927. He was a prominent member of a number of Philadelphia Jewish and other civic and charitable organizations. Rebecca Gratz, the famous Philadelphia Jewish leader, was Charles' godmother.\n\n\n\nMary M. Cohen was born in Philadelphia February 26, 1854 and died in Atlantic City, New Jersey on July 2, 1911. She was a leading exponent of Jewish and women's causes, a journalist, writer, and poet.

This port of entry document is from Harmond Hendricks  . shipping finished copper to Curacao\n\n\n\n1 of 1\n\n\n\nThe Hendricks family of New York helped lay the foundation for the Industrial Revolution in America. Their pioneering production of copper was vital to the growth of the American economy and the nation's military might. When the company closed in 1938, Hendricks Brothers was the oldest continuous privately held Jewish family business in the United States.\n\n\n\nUriah Hendricks, the patriarch of the family, was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1737 and emigrated from London to New York City in 1755. In New York, he opened a dry goods store and became an active member, and eventually parnas, or president, of Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. The congregation served as the unifying institution of the New York Jewish community, which numbered about 200 people. In 1764, Hendricks established a metals business, importing copper and brass from England, which discouraged manufacture of these commodities in the American colonies. On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928. Hendricks Brothers closed its last copper mill in 1938.\n\n\n\nJust as Harmon Hendricks was able to build a business that his descendants maintained, he was able to continue a tradition of religious commitment that his father, Uriah, had bequeathed to him. Each of Harmon's children found a spouse among the families at Shearith Israel. Son Henry joined his father-in-law, Tobias I. Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz. In 1852, Henry Hendricks and eight others founded Jews' Hospital, now Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, the oldest Jewish medical institution in the United States.\n\n\n\nIsaac Leeser, editor of The Occident, the leading American Jewish newspaper of the pre-Civil War era, was often critical of what he considered the aloof and uncharitable attitudes of the Sephardic grandees. To quote Maxwell Whiteman, however, Leeser singled out the liberality of the Hendricks family as an exception ��_ Modesty and reserve continued to govern the family attitude in matters of philanthropy, and the practice of keeping such activity from the public eye, begun by Harmon Hendricks, was maintained by his descendants.\n\n\n\nIn the same low-key and generous manner, the Hendricks family descendants continue to be active in Shearith Israel and in Jewish communal life today.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{78262FAD-D0C8-4BC3-84D1-2A43197CA9A6}","objects_refno":"2008.08.25.00029","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.25.00029","objects_customfield_5":"Hendricks , Harmond","objects_objtype":"PORT OF ENTRY","objects_date":"5/30/1830","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Port of entry document from Harmond Hendricks, shipping finished copper to Curacao","person_nam":"Hendricks, Harmon","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Hendricks, Harmon","location":"New York, NY","date":"1830-05-30T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 852","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_852_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_852_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1484,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref3869","ref_2":"cid4638193","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Receipts","descriptio":"Spelman Brothers.

He belonged to a family of conversos who professed Catholicism while they continued to practice Judaism in secret. In 1750 Lopez married a woman named Anna, and within two years the couple had a daughter, Catherine.  In 1752 Duarte and his family moved to Newport, where they lived as Jews and became Aaron, Abigail, and Sarah.\n\n\n\nBy the early 1770s, Lopez had become the wealthiest person in Newport; his tax assessment was twice that of any other resident. The reason he was successful was that his business interests were so diverse. He manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, and chocolate. He had business interests in the production of textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles. Ezra Stiles, the Congregational minister in Newport and future president of Yale College, described Lopez as a merchant of the first eminence and wrote that the extent of [his] commerce probably [was] surpassed by no merchant in America\n\n\n\nLopez supported a number of charitable causes in Newport. He purchased books for the Redwood Library and Athenaeum. He contributed lumber to help build the College of Rhode Island (which later relocated to Providence and eventually became Brown University), and he donated land to establish Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts. Lopez was a leading contributor who helped build the Touro Synagogue, and he was given the honor of laying one of its cornerstones.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1770s, with growing tensions between Britain and its American colonies, Lopez's fortunes began to decline. The Continental Association enforced a boycott against trade with Britain. In October 1775, the British navy anchored outside Newport's harbor and the population began to evacuate the city. In early 1776 Lopez relocated to Portsmouth, Rhode Island; then to Providence, Boston, and finally to Leicester, Massachusetts. Historian Marilyn Kaplan describes Lopez's losses during the American Revolution as monumental.\n\n\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Lopez harbored Jewish refugees in his Leicester home. Referring to those sheltered by Lopez, a friend wrote in jest that your family at present are in a number only 99 and still there is room for one more\n\n\n\nOn May 28, 1782, while returning with his family from Leicester to Newport, Lopez drowned when his horse and carriage fell into a pond.\n\n\n\n\tThe Vernon brothers, William and Samuel, made a name for themselves in Newport by successfully utilizing the triangle trade. Their first ship, commanded by Captain John Godfrey, was ironically named the Olive Branch. The brothers also owned the Hare, a ship whose participation in the American slave trade is well documented. Incredible profits were made by purchasing slaves in Africa with rum from the colonies, selling those slaves in the West Indies, using those profits to purchase molasses from those ports before buying more rum in the colonies, continuing the triangular cycle of trade.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe Vernons are known as the first Newport merchants to sell African slaves directly to the southern colonies, instead of exclusively in the West Indies. Their ships returning from the West Indies offloaded slaves in South Carolina in exchange for barrels of rice destined for markets in New England. Their first sale to the southern colonies was made in Charleston in 1755. These brothers serve as a perfect example of the pivotal role many northern colonies played in the American slave trade \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1628DAD3-0C33-4CB2-B262-066DDA4C7E99}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02887","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02887","objects_customfield_5":"LOPEZ, AARON","objects_objtype":"Receipt","objects_date":"8/24/1769","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Lopez, Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Lopez, Aaron","location":"Newport, RI","date":"1769-08-24T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder P","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"3","tiff_locat":"lbr_fp_s3_1r.tif; lbr_fp_s3_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.407897,41.117596]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1698,"longitude":-73.4078965,"latitude":41.11759561,"ref_1":"ref3484","ref_2":"cid4638575","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Official documents","descriptio":"Adams, Daniel.

Petition to the Bankrupcy Court on velem signed by Benjamin Nones ceditors of; receipt of full payment...$23,233; .ASD  TWO JEWISH CREDITORS  & 15 others.\n\n\n\nIt is this the very document that Nones references in his famous 1800 editorial when he was attacked as a Republican, a Jew and being poor (not paying his debts).\n\n\n\nIn the early Republic, the first two political parties, Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans routinely and falsely charged one another with corruption, sexual scandal and even treason. In Philadelphia in 1800, the Federalists introduced anti-Semitism into the political fray. \n\nA vivid example is the vicious attack launched against Benjamin Nones. Born in France in 1757, Nones immigrated to Philadelphia around 1772. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Nones chose to fight for his adopted nation. In 1777, Nones saw heavy action as part of General Pulaski's legion. He earned the rank of major with a citation for bravery. \n\n\n\nAfter the war, Nones returned to Philadelphia a war hero, but struggled to make a living. As a notary public and government interpreter, he barely earned enough to feed his growing family, which eventually numbered 14 children. Nonetheless, he was active in civic and Jewish communal affairs. Nones served as an officer of the Society of Ezrath Orchim, the first organized Jewish charity in Philadelphia and as president of that city's Congregation Mikveh Israel. He was also an active member of an anti-slavery society. \n\n\n\nPhiladelphia was rife with political rivalry throughout the 1790s with Nones in the thick of it. The conservative Federalists, representing the interests of merchants and financial speculators, battled Jeffersonian Republicans, who presented themselves as the party of small businessmen, farmers, artisans and laborers. Many Jews in the young nation leaned toward the Jeffersonians, considering them more favorable to religious liberty for minorities. \n\n\n\nThe Federalists responded to the Jewish penchant for Jeffersonianism with a barrage of anti-Semitic attacks. In August 1800, Benjamin Nones became their target. \n\n\n\nThat summer  Nones  participated in a Republican convention in Philadelphia. The city's leading Federalist newspaper, the Gazette, published a scurrilous account of the meeting, calling all who attended the filth of society. It singled out Nones for its ugliest attack. Citizen N----, it sneered, was a Jew, a Republican, and poor, the three worst epithets in the Federalists' lexicon. \n\n\n\nNones immediately penned an impassioned response. When the Gazette refused to publish it, even as a paid article, he took it to the Aurora, the city's Jeffersonian newspaper, which was happy to run it. Although hot with indignation, Nones's reply conveys a dignity that transcends nearly two centuries. \n\n\n\nI am a Jew. I glory in belonging to that persuasion, which even its opponents, whether Christian, or Mahomedan, allow to be of divine origin -- of that persuasion on which Christianity itself was originally founded, and must ultimately rest -- which has preserved its faith secure and undefiled, for near three thousand years, whose votaries have never murdered each other in religious wars, or cherished the theological hatred so general, so inextinguishable among those who revile them.... \n\n\n\nI am a Republican!...I have not been so proud or so prejudiced as to renounce the cause for which I have fought, as an American throughout the whole of the revolutionary war....I am a Jew, and if for no other reason, for that reason am I a republican...In republics we have rights, in monarchies we live but to experience wrongs .... How then can a Jew but be a Republican?... \n\n\n\nBut I am poor, I am so, my family also is large, but soberly and decently brought up. They have not been taught to revile a Christian because his religion is not so old as theirs.... \n\n\n\nNones's letter breathes the fire of pride in his religion and nation. His manifesto links American Jews with the ideals of democratic government, individual liberty and toleration and reveals Nones as both a distinguished Jew and patriot. \n\n\n\n  \n\n","thing_uuid":"{A0F7C10F-D149-4BFC-98CA-07D7E4CB2EAF}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03105","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03105","objects_customfield_5":"Nones, Benjamin / Phillips, Jonas / Cohen, Jacob","objects_objtype":"Court","objects_date":"1/12/1795","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Petition to the Bankrupcy Court on velem signed by Benjamin Nones.

As a member of the harrowing American arctic expedition under the command of Dr. Elisha Kent Kane in search of the lost British explorer Sir John Franklin, Hayes became obsessed with making his own mark in the far northern polar regions. He organized his own privately funded voyage to the Arctic in 1860, during which he claimed to have reached a farthest north and to have stood on the edge of the fabled Open Polar Sea, a mythical ice-free zone in the high northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nThrough his own hard fought experiences, combined with the knowledge learned from native Greenlanders or Polar Eskimos, he successfully influenced the course of Arctic discovery, causing perceptive explorers to follow his guidance and lead. Directing the same ambition to humanitarian and social causes, during the devastating U.S. Civil War and as an elected politician in New York State during its Gilded Age, Hayes served the public good for a decade, with accomplishments as far reaching as his Arctic service, but little recognized even during his lifetime. In this book, which draws upon Hayes family papers, the little viewed diaries from Hayes s own expeditions, as well as other unpublished primary sources, the story emerges of a remarkable but forgotten explorer, writer, politician, and humanitarian who epitomized the rugged and restless spirit of adventure and individualism of 19th-century America.

Later, he was commissioned in the engineers and was involved in the construction of two forts in Virginia. Eventually, he became commander of the Washington Arsenal. The military sent him and Captain George B. McClellan, who became one of the top generals in the Civil War, to observe the Crimean War in 1854. They were granted a private conference with Czar Nicholas I and Mordecai's observations were published by Congress. \n\n\n\nMordecai made important contributions to the military technology with his introduction of scientific research and development to the military art. He wrote several notable books on the military, which included Second Report of Experiments in Gun Powder (1849) and Ordinance Manual for the Use of Officers of the United States Army (1841, revised in 1950). \n\n\n\nWhen the Civil War between the states broke out in 1861, it created a dilemma for him. He was tom with his love for the South, his distaste for secession and his loyalty to the army and country. Mordecai made a decision to retire from the U.S. Army at age 57, so he wouldn't have to fight against either side. His devotion to his conscience probably cost him a higher place in American history. When he resigned, he was one of the best military professionals in the country. He was on a par with all the well-known generals of the Civil War. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{5948D42D-B272-44AA-BDD8-74E4E7D5C5B1}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03699","objects_customfield_6":"First American Jewish Families by Stern","objects_customfield_5":"MORDECAI, SARAH ANN (1805.1894) / HAYS, RICHEA (1774.1858)","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"1/1/1835","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter written by Sarah Ann Mordecai (1805-1894) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to her mother, Richea Gratz Hays, with the care of Samuel Etting in Baltimore, Maryland.

See the background below re: the controversy. While period to the 1850's controversy it is not in Leeser's hand. Very possbly it was a insert from a letter to Leeser oin the subject. It was found with other Leeser papers.This document has been reviewed and verified at the Katz Center of the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Arthur Kiron, the Schottenstein-Jesselson Curator of Judaica Collections and Bruce Nielsen, Judaica Public Services Librarian and Archivist, who is a trained paleographer,\n\n\n\nThe title of the document is in fine block Hebrew with points and he uses fine block Hebrew without points as he quotes sources in his explanation. The document is from the year of the controversy _�_1850.\n\n\n\nHe starts with four separate _��Translations_ѝ of I will be what I will be Exodus 3:14 from (1) Septuagint (English version)_�_ he writes and translates the Greek, (2) Vulgata: Luther _�_ he writes and translates the Latin, (3) De Wette, Van Els, Allioli_�_. writes and translates the German and (4) Dr. Philipson_�_ writes and translates the German.  The writer then in the second part goes into the _��Explanations_ѝ from various sources including Philo (life of Moses) and he writes and translates the Greek.\n\n\n\nIf this is not in the hand of Isaac Leeser, could it be a transmittal from Rev.

LATER HE WAS TO BECOME A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON; AMERICAN JEWERY; The college lasted 2/1/1867.1873;\n\n\n\n   Sabato Morais, American rabbi; born at Leghorn, Italy, April 13, 1823; died at Philadelphia Nov. 11, 1897. He was the elder son and the third of nine children of Samuel and Bona Morais. The Morais family came originally from Portugal, being probably among the large number of Jews who fled thence from the Inquisition. At the time of Sabato's birth Italy was in the thick of her great struggle for freedom. Samuel Morais was an ardent republican, at one time undergoing imprisonment for his political views; and his father, Sabato Morais, was prominently identified with the political movements of his day. Upon young Sabato early rested the responsibility of aiding in the support of the family. While still a child he earned a little by teaching Hebrew hymns and prayers to other children, meantime pursuing his own studies under Rabbis Funaro, Curiat, and others, and then under his Hebrew master, Rabbi Abraham Baruch Piperno, and gaining honorable mention in belles-lettres under Prof. Salvatore de Benedetti. In addition to Hebrew and Italian, he acquired familiarity with Aramaic, French, and Spanish. He remained at his home studying and teaching until 1845, when he went to London to apply for the vacant post of assistant ?azzan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city. Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home; but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini; and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais. \n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mickve Israel congregation at Philadelphia, Pa., became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. In 1855 he married Clara Esther Weil, who died in 1872, leaving seven children. From the date of his installation as ?azzan until his death his influence was a continually growing power for conservative Judaism. The synagogue now occupied by the Mickve Israel congregation was built and consecrated during his incumbency. Though his ministry covered the period of greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity. His sermons covered a wide scope of thought and action; and he showed the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil war, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show his warm sympathy with the cause of the slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members. \n\n\n\nWhen, in 1867, Maimonides College was established in Philadelphia, Morais was made professor of the Bible and of Biblical literature; and he held the chair during the six years that the college existed. For a number of years thereafter he felt the urgent need of an institution for the training of Jewish ministers on historical and traditional lines; and the declarations of the Pittsburg Conference in 1885 urged him to immediate action. After a considerable agitation of the subject he succeeded, in conjunction with a few others, in establishing (Jan., 1886) the Jewish Theological Seminary at New York. He was at once made president of the faculty and professor of Bible, holding both posts until his death. Unquestionably the establishment of the seminary constitutes Morais' most lasting influence upon Judaism in America. The directors of that body have fittingly recognized his memory by naming the chair of Biblical literature and exegesis the Sabato Morais professorship. In 1887 the University of Pennsylvania conferred upon him the honorary degree of doctor of laws, he being the first Jew so honored by that institution.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the work which he did in official positions, Morais was most active in religious, educational, and charity matters. The Hebrew Sunday-School, Society, the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia, and the Young Men's Hebrew Association of that city numbered him among their most steadfast friends. In his own home he gathered about him a small band of young men whom he instructed in Hebrew, Talmud, and Jewish history, and in whom he inspired a zealous love for Judaism which has had a very marked effect upon the character not only of his pupils, but of the community at large. The strong conservatism of the Jews of Philadelphia and the warm interest in the higher things of Judaism evinced by the younger men of that city may be in a large measure directly traced to the influence of Sabato Morais. He was greatly interested in the Alliance Isra��lite Universelle, and was in constant correspondence with rabbis and scholars in Europe and the Orient. Through his friend Chevalier Emanuel Felice Veneziani, the almoner of Baron de Hirsch, he was enabled to secure timely aid for the agricultural colonies in New Jersey and was the representative of Baron de Hirsch in the Carmel Colony. \n\n\n\nWhen the Russo-Jewish exodus began, in 1882, and Russian Jews in large numbers settled in Philadelphia, Morais immediately became their friend. Although unable to speak their language, his perfect familiarity with Hebrew as a living tongue gave him a ready means of communication. Among Gentiles also he was widely known and esteemed, and was very frequently called upon to address public assemblies. \n\n\n\nBesides his sermons, he contributed to Jewish literature much in the form of addresses to various Jewish organizations and of theological, polemical, literary, and critical articles for the Jewish press at home and abroad. He wrote classic Hebrew in prose and in verse with ease and elegance. Among his later works are: a translation of the Prolegomena to a Grammar of the Hebrew Language, by S. D. Luzzatto (in Fifth Biennial Reprotport of the Jewish Theological Seminary); An Essay on the Jew in Italy (in Second Biennial Report  of the same); Italian Jewish Literature (in Publications of Gratz College, 1897). His translation of the Book of Jeremiah for the Bible of the Jewish Publication Society of America was completed shortly before his death.\n\n \n\n    \n\n","thing_uuid":"{1100FBD8-602A-45EB-A257-2467F59C1D0A}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03241","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03241","objects_customfield_5":"MORAIS, SABATO (1823.1897)","objects_objtype":"PASSPORT","objects_date":"1/1/1854","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"The Italian passport of Sabato Morais (1823-1897), who was born in Livorno, Italy","person_nam":"Morais, Sabato","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Morais, Sabato","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1854-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder A","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"20","tiff_locat":"lbr_fa_s20_1r.tif; lbr_fa_s20_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2057,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref3238","ref_2":"cid4638819","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Miscellaneous","descriptio":"Unknown.

Schoenfeld & signed by  Jonas Schoenfeld. Printed with Jonas store address.\n\n\n\nSalomen D. Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.

Dated July, 1824, Savannah, Georgia. This was the same year as his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania with an M. D. The one page letter is signed by the President as well as the Vice President of the Georgia Medical Society, an MD and a retired Post Surgeon of the US Army. He was appointed to the position on 4/12/1826 by Adj. General R. Jones as reported in the Niles Register.\n\n\n\nThis is the earliest existent letter of recommendation of a Jew to be an officer in the US Army. In addition Philip Minis is noted in various Jewish American history books for killing James Jones Stark in Savannah due to anti-Semitic slurs. See an article in AJHS July 1955_�_it uses a letters written by Sally Minis and diary of Minis' 2nd in the duel. \n\n\n\nPhilip Minis (1805-1856) was a physician and the son of Isaac Minis (Isaac the son of Philip and Judith Minis; said to have been born in 1780, in a cave near Charleston, S. C., while that city was besieged and while Savannah was in the hands of the British). Philip served in the US Army as an Assistant Surgeon, appointed 4/12/1826 by Adj. General R. Jones as reported in the Niles Register. In 1836 he was elevated to a full Surgeon with the rank of Major in the 31st Regiment of the U.S. Artillery (married in NYC same year) and resigned in 1837_�_.Georgia Historical Society 1917 Vol. 1 & 2. By 1839 he was back in Savannah practicing as a Doctor, running a brick yard and sat on the board of various charitable societies. See Third to None by Rubin_�_page 87.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dual and Trial\n\n\n\nThe friction between Stark and Minis dated at least to the spring of 1832. According to Richard D. Arnold, a friend of Minis', Stark insulted the absent Minis in Luddington's barroom, calling him a damned Jew who ought to be pissed upon and so forth. He declined to repeat the insults in Minis's presence and offered a private explanation deemed acceptable by a friend of Minis. According to Minis's sister Sarah, Stark made anti-Semitic comments directly to Minis in April but offered an apology.\n\n\n\n In July, Stark denied having apologized for his comments. Minis then wrote to demand an apology or satisfaction, and Stark agreed to the duel.\n\n\n\n On August 9, the seconds (Thomas Wayne for Stark and Charles Spalding for Minis) began their negotiations. Spalding did not agree to Wayne's proposal of rifles at Scriven's Ferry, South Carolina later in the afternoon. He objected that Minis' rifle (an unusual choice of weapon) was being repaired, and that the duel should be delayed at least until the following day. Stark and Wayne nonetheless crossed the river to Scriven's Ferry, discharged rifles, and declared victory. Their belligerence during a meeting on the street, coupled with rumors of Minis' cowardice, insured the affair would not rest.\n\n\n\nOn August 10, Minis and Spalding went to the barroom of the City Hotel; when informed of their presence, Stark and Wayne came downstairs. Minis called Stark a coward. Stark may have produced or reached for a pistol (accounts varied) and Minis shot him through the chest, killing him instantly. Minis' friends persuaded him to relinquish his weapon to Spalding (though not before he threatened to fire into the crowd) and withdraw to his office to await the sheriff, who arrived within the hour.[6] The coroner's inquest returned a verdict of deliberate murder.\n\n\n\nMinis' trial was delayed until a disinterested judge could be found; both principals had connections to the judiciary. Minis' father, Isaac, was a judge on the inferior court and Superior Court Judge William Law was related to Stark by marriage. Law's impartiality may have been questioned for other reasons: he was a member of the Anti-Dueling Association [9] and had suggested potentially prejudicial wording for a notice in the Georgian to which editor Richard D. Arnold objected.  Judge Charles Dougherty was imported from the Western Circuit to preside over the trial in January 1833. It lasted six days, and after deliberating for two hours the jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty.\n\n\n\n Though many had initially believed Minis guilty, public animosity apparently did not survive the acquittal. He rose to the rank of major in the Army and enjoyed a successful career as a physician and businessman.\n\n\n\n Social context: Anti-Dueling and Temperance movements\n\n \n\nThe frequency of duels spurred the creation of the Savannah Anti-Dueling Association in 1826. Its goals were general education (furthered by meetings, publications, and essay contests) and practical intervention. The Association drafted letters to the seconds of Stark and Minis, offering arbitration. Southern society was unprepared to relinquish the duel, and the Association became inactive by 1837.The following year, former South Carolina governor John Lyde Wilson set forth rules governing dueling in The Code of Honor, a native alternative to the Irish Code Duello of 1777. Duelists continued to fight in Savannah for decades, with the last fatality recorded in 1870.\n\n \n\nWilson's Code acknowledged that intoxication could lower inhibitions; it was thus not a full excuse for insult, but it will greatly palliate. Barrooms featured prominently in the Stark-Minis case. Alcohol-related violence among the concerns of the Savannah Temperance Society, founded shortly after Minis' trial. One of the Society's founders, William R. Waring, was motivated in part by the shooting at the City Hotel. He had been among those who disarmed Minis.\n\n \n\nThe building where Stark died is allegedly haunted, with phantom shoves, the crack of a pistol, and ghostly figures having been reported. Like other Savannah locations, the pub now occupying the City Hotel capitalizes upon tourist interest in the supernatural. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{F5ADE875-C6A9-42A4-A1BA-A11D2A91E5CC}","objects_refno":"2012.01.05.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.01.05.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Minis, Philip","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"7/1/1824","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Minis, Philip","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Minis, Philip","location":"Savannah, GA","date":"1824-07-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"GA 60","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ga_60_1r.tif; doc_ja_ga_60_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.748877,39.457598]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2648,"longitude":-77.74887729,"latitude":39.45759842,"ref_1":"ref3834","ref_2":"cid4638228","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Receipts","descriptio":"RECEIPT FOR HAY & CORN...$15.38; ASD BY ABOVE...1ST DIVISION CSA; ; ;","thing_uuid":"{EF619340-046A-44F0-BC80-E871E8F9CB21}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03305","objects_customfield_6":"NEEDS RESEARCH","objects_customfield_5":"MYERS, AARON","objects_objtype":"RECEIPT","objects_date":"9/12/1863","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Civil War","descript_1":"Receipt for hay and corn","person_nam":"Myers, Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Myers, Aaron","location":"Sharpsburg, VA","date":"1863-09-12T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder M","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"6","tiff_locat":"lbr_fm_s6_1r.tif; lbr_fm_s6_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.197887,38.627269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2670,"longitude":-90.19788659,"latitude":38.6272691,"ref_1":"ref484","ref_2":"cid4641557","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"Friedman Bros. & Schafer.

He was considered the most prominent Jew in Missouri during the 19th century. One of the prominent characters in St. Louis during the Civil War was Isidor Busch, a wine-merchant. He was one of the delegates on the Unconditional Union Ticket to a convention which decided that Missouri should remain in the Union.\n\nAt the age of 15 he became involved in the printing business and began the study of foreign languages. He soon became part owner of Schmid & Bush, which became one of Vienna's largest publishers. When the Revolution of 1848 failed he had to flee to New York, where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849 and opened a small stationery and bookstore in New York. His weekly journal Israel's Herold failed after only three months.\n\n He moved to St. Louis the same year, where he opened a general store while continuing to write articles for various journals. In 1870 he organized the firm of Isidor Bush & Company, which became one of the most successful wine and liquor enterprises in St. Louis. He also became the general passenger agent and auditor for the St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railroad Company and served as president of Peoples' Savings Bank in St. Louis. Bush was closely associated with B'nai B'rith and helped to develop the B'nai B'rith Cleveland Orphans Home as well as developing several national insurance and endowment programs for the organization. Bush served as secretary to General John Fremont during the Civil War and also served on the St. Louis Board of Education and the City Council. He attended several state conventions during the Civil War period as a delegate from St. Louis and was a strong opponent to slavery. \n\n\n\nLater in life Bush became interested in viticulture. He purchased a tract of land (named by him Bushberg) outside the city, which became noted for its products. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, The Bushberg Catalogue, which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{46C4ACD7-BD9E-4F8C-BE56-4C2647F218EB}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03732","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03732","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / BUSH, ISADORE (1822.1898)","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"12/8/1853","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from Isadore Bush (1822-1898) in St. Louis, Missouri to Isaac Leeser, in which Bush conveys his views on the state of Judaism, and takes Leeser to task for some of his views","person_nam":"Leeser, Isaac","person_n_1":"Bush, Isidor","corporatio":"","merger":"Bush, Isidor | Leeser, Isaac","location":"St. Louis, MO","date":"1853-12-08T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Leeser","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"Missouri","tiff_locat":"LSKAP0102_1r.tif; LSKAP0102_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.450706,41.621479]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2701,"longitude":-74.45070596,"latitude":41.6214789,"ref_1":"ref1434","ref_2":"cid4640613","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Broadsides","descriptio":"Finkle's Tavern.

It was written from the Washington Arsenal.\n\n\n\nMajor Alfred Mordecai was born in Warrentown, North Carolina, in 1804 and died in 1887. He entered West Point at age 15 and he graduated first in his class in 1823. Upon graduation, Mordecai became an assistant professor at the United States Military Academy in New York. Later, he was commissioned in the engineers and was involved in the construction of two forts in Virginia. Eventually, he became commander of the Washington Arsenal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMordecai was recognized for his meritorious service in the line of duty during the Mexican War (1845-1847) with his promotion to Major. When the war was over, he was sent to Mexico to adjust claims for losses suffered by Mexicans during the conflict. The military sent him and Captain George B. McClellan, who became one of the top generals in the Civil War, to observe the Crimean War in 1854. They were granted a private conference with Czar Nicholas I and Mordecai's observations were published by Congress. Mordecai made important contributions to the military technology with his introduction of scientific research and development to the military art. He wrote several notable books on the military, which included Second Report of Experiments in Gun Powder (1849) and Ordinance Manual for the Use of Officers of the United States Army (1841, revised in 1850). \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Civil War between the states broke out in 1861, it created a dilemma for him. He was tom with his love for the South, his distaste for secession and his loyalty to the army and country. Mordecai made a decision to retire from the U.S. Army at age 57, so he wouldn't have to fight against either side. His devotion to his conscience probably cost him a higher place in American history. When he resigned, he was one of the best military professionals in the country. He was on a par with all the well-known generals of the Civil War. His son, Alfred Mordecai, Jr., whose feelings were less sensitive to his Southern heritage, joined the North in the Civil War in 1861. He died with the rank of General in 1920. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{0BD13048-7C31-4F50-85B1-5AECAEE82F7E}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03324","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03324","objects_customfield_5":"MORDECAI, ALFRED CAPT.

HAVE YOU TURNED YOUR; ATTENTION TO THE DECISION IN THE SURPREME COURT OF THE USA IN THE CASE COHEN vs; THE STATE OF VIRGINIA?..HAVE YOU SEEN THE ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ALEXANDER SMYTH IN; THE SURPREME COURT, ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA? ONE OF TWO LANDMARK DECISIONS; CONFIRMING RIGHT OF SURPREME CT TO REVEIW STATE CT DECISIONS ON FEDERAL LAW.\n\n\n\n Philip and Mendez Cohen of Norfolk were selling the D.C. lottery tickets in Norfolk, VA contrary to Virginia Law. The Supreme Court took up the complaint since it tested the relationship of Federal law to state laws. In Cohens v. Virginia crowned a series of decisions asserting the Supreme Court's authority to, in the words of Marshall, decide all cases of every description under the laws of the United States. In this 1821 decision, Marshall legally demolished the claims of states' rights which would politically plunge the nation into Civil War in 1861: The Constitution and laws of a state, insofar as they are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States are absolutely void.\n\nIt was a cynical appeal, brought by two highly paid lawyers, on behalf of two speculators hoping to reap a multi-state harvest from a District of Columbia lottery. But it provided Chief Justice Marshall with grounds to assert the supremacy of the Union over the states. In words that anticipated those of Abraham Lincoln in defending the Union 40 years later, Marshall unequivocally asserted the We, the People with which the Constitution began meant the Union, Congress and the Supreme Court created by that Constitution reigned over the states: The United States form . . . a single nation . . . In war, we are one people. In all commercial regulations, we are one and the same people. In many other respects, the American people are one; and the government which is alone capable of controlling and managing their interests in all these respects is the government of the Union. It is their government, and in that character they have no other, Marshall declared in perhaps his most important decision--and in some of his most ringing words: America has chosen to be a . . . nation; and for all these purposes, her government is complete . . . it is competent . . . it is supreme.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{B414256A-9A4E-48B2-A6CA-3AEB706BEE99}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03232","objects_customfield_6":"SEE FILE ON THIS CASE","objects_customfield_5":"Cohen, Philip / Cohen,  Mendez","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"6/30/1821","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Letter from Andrew Russell to his brother, Col.

Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, Pa. They are both strong personalities with increasing divergent views that will subsequently lay the ground work for their falling out. In this letter, one reads the not so subtle hint of Rabbi Wise's strongly held opinions.\n\n\n\nThe letter has good content and includes the following comment Dr. Raphael is an orator, a poet, an original genius but, no scholar as I thought him to be. There is much in his lectures that could be criticized, but I have no desire to do it, since I doubt it any good would come of it \n\n\n\n Dr. Arthur Kiron (U of P) has led me to the context of the observations by Wise. On 2/25/1850, Wise was in Charleston, S.C. to be considered for the job at Beth Elohim that was to be vacated by Rev. Pozanski. That evening he was invited to a private home to hear a debate between Rev. Pozanski and Dr. Raphael , the debate became heated and Rabbi Wise stepped in on the side of Dr. Raphael who did little to debate the points made by Rev. Pozanski.\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple note item #34 @ Kestenbaum Auction 9/05 sold for $2360\n\n\n\nSketch on Wise's Career:\n\nDuring his lifetime Wise was regarded as the most prominent Reform Jew of his time in the United States. His genius for organization was of a very high order; and he was masterful, rich in resources, and possessed of an inflexible will. More than of any of his contemporaries, it may be said of him that he left the impress of his personality upon the development of Reform Judaism in the United States.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWise emigrated to the United States in 1846. He arrived in New York on July 23, and in October was appointed rabbi of the Congregation Beth-El of Albany. He soon began agitating for reforms in the service, and his was the first Jewish congregation in the United States to introduce family pews in the synagogue. A mixed choir, and confirmation were also among the innovations introduced by Wise, who even went so far as to count women in forming a minyan or religious quorum\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAs early as 1848 Wise issued a call to the ministers and other Israelites of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. His call appeared in the columns of the Occident, and was ably seconded by its editor, Isaac Leeser. Wise suggested that a meeting be held in the spring of 1849 at Philadelphia, to establish a union of the congregations of the entire country. This meeting did not take place; but the originator of the idea never ceased advocating it, especially after he had established his own newspaper, The Israelite (July 1854, restyled The American Israelite July 1874), in the columns of which he tirelessly expounded his views upon the subject. His persistence won its reward when in 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati.\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 1850, a fistfight between Wise and the synagogue's president caused a split in the Albany community, and the consequent formation of a new congregation, the Anshe Emeth, by the friends and supporters of Wise. Wise remained with this congregation until April, 1854, when he became rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun congregation of the Lodge Street Synagogue of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he officiated for the remaining forty-six years of his life. Wise was above all an organizer, and called numerous institutions into being. He organized the building of the Plum Street Temple in 1866. The temple, noted for its architectural grandeur, was renamed the Isaac M. Wise Temple in his honor.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nHe was indefatigable in insisting upon the pressing need of a theological seminary for the training of rabbis for American pulpits.

History is indeed the teacher of life and the best conductor through the career of life; History is a second and very distinct revelation.  God placed Moses on a rack, where he should learn to know God by His divine Attributes.  Maimonides calls that rock nature and I add to it History both of them reveal the God of/ Israel in His Glory and Majesty.

Where is Sabbath, Festivals, Milah, Shehite, Tefilin, Mesusah, Zizith, Pidyon Bechar, Mazah and many other commands understood under, love they neighbor?  He pleases to translate/ the word of the Talmud [Hebrew], And thou/ shalt love they neighbour as theyself, is the principal command of the law; but every one will understand that the/ [Hebrew] could be spared, I presume, it ought/ to be translated: Love thy neighbor as thyself is one of the grand principles of our law, but there are still others/ principles and germs, as: love God, be holy etc but they are above the horizon of many people, as it was the case/ with the Prosalite demanding of Hillel to learn him all/ the Torah while standing on one foot.  Does perhaps Truth suppose/ we shall learn to love our God to become fit and willingly/ to love our neighbour?  Now, Sir, we love our neighbour in order to learn to love also our God, then the latter is a higher principle than the former.  Or does he suppose, that we shall be holy in order that our manners and feelings towards our fellow-mortal should be pure?

His call appeared in the columns of the Occident, and was ably seconded by its editor, Isaac Leeser. Wise suggested that a meeting be held in the spring of 1849 at Philadelphia, to establish a union of the congregations of the entire country. This meeting did not take place; but the originator of the idea never ceased advocating it, especially after he had established his own newspaper, The Israelite (July 1854, restyled The American Israelite July 1874), in the columns of which he tirelessly expounded his views upon the subject.

Wise remained with this congregation until April, 1854, when he became rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun congregation of the Lodge Street Synagogue of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he officiated for the remaining forty-six years of his life. Wise was above all an organizer, and called numerous institutions into being. He organized the building of the Plum Street Temple in 1866.

Baltimore St., Factory 10 & 12 N. Howard St.\n\n\n\nPrinted on both sides\n\n\n\n1882: Seventeen-year-old Lithuanian immigrant Jacob Epstein starts the Baltimore Bargain House, which he grows into one of the nation's largest wholesale dry-goods operations. Through Epstein's influence, Jewish peddlers and shopkeepers settle throughout the South, establishing a strong retail presence and numerous small communities.\n\n\n\nHe was born in Lithuania in 1865, emigrated to America in 1882 as a 17-year-old, pretty much a penniless teenager. \n\nHe would grow to become a legend in Baltimore and regional business circles before his death in 1945. According to Gilbert Sandler's book Jewish Baltimore: A Family Album, Mr. Epstein worked hard and became one of the wealthiest and most philanthropic of Baltimore's Jews. \n\n\n\nHe opened his business at 48 West Barre St., retailing pots, pans and clothing in South Baltimore. Like so many merchants, he lived over the store. That store grew into one of the largest retail outlets of its time, the Baltimore Bargain House. \n\n\n\nJacob and his wife, Lena, were longtime members of Temple Oheb Shalom. \n\n\n\nJacob Epstein was the godfather of South Baltimore, quotes Mr. Sandler's book. He gave everybody a job at the Bargain House. \n\n\n\nHe was also known as the man who taught the city to give.

At the age of nine he was taken by his father, who was banker to the King of Sweden, to Copenhagen, where he was educated at the Hebrew grammar-school. Later he went to England, where he devoted himself to the study of languages, for the better acquisition of which he subsequently traveled in France, Germany, and Belgium. He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Erlangen (Germany). After lecturing on Hebrew poetry he began to publish the Hebrew Review, and Magazine of Rabbinical Literature, which he was forced to discontinue in 1836 owing to ill health.\n\n\n\nFor some time he acted as honorary secretary to Solomon Herschell, chief rabbi of Great Britain. He made translations from Maimonides, Albo, and Herz Wessely; conjointly with the Rev. D. A. de Sola he published a translation of eighteen treatises of the Mishnah; he also began a translation of the Pentateuch, of which only one volume appeared. In 1840, when the blood accusation was made at Damascus, he published a refutation of it in four languages (Hebrew, English, French, and German) and wrote a defense of Judaism against an anonymous writer in the London Times. Raphall was also the author of a text-book of the post-Biblical history of the Jews (to the year 70 C.E.).\n\n\n\nIn 1841 he was appointed minister of the Birmingham Synagogue and master of the school. He continued in these capacities for eight years, and then sailed for New York (1849). In that city he was appointed rabbi and preacher of the B'nei Jeshurun congregation, where he continued as pastor till 1866, his duties then being relaxed owing to his infirm health. He died at New York on June 23, 1868.\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbi Raphall, of New York's Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, was the first Rabbi to offer prayers at the opening of the House of Representatives; he did so in 1860.

The first attempt was in 1859 with the formation of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites.  \n\n\n\nThese two documents are the only surviving evidence of the active role Baltimore took on the Mortara Affair under the leadership of S.

This role does not seem to have found its way into American Jewish history books.\n\n.\n\nHISTORY��_On June 23rd, 1858, 6-year-old Edgardo Mortara of Italy was taken from his home and handed over to the Catholic Church after it was discovered he had been secretly baptized by his nursemaid. A Catholic in Italy could not legally be raised by Jews, even his own parents. This event was criticized by many Jews and non-Jews alike in Europe. \n\n\n\nMoses Montefiore wrote a report on his mission to Rome on behalf of the Edgardo Mortara affair that catalyzed American Jew sentiment. Two thousand Jews in New York City (and countless others around the country) rally to demand U.S. intervention on behalf of Edgar Mortara. From the pulpit of Beth-El-Emeth that Leeser formed an ad hoc committee of several Philadelphia Synagogues (exclusive of Mikvah Israel that refused to join) to protest the Mortara Affair. Their delegates reached the Buchanan White House. President James Buchanan refuses the requests of American Jews to intercede with the Vatican on the grounds that it might alienate Irish Catholics who are loyal Democratic supporters. Despite numerous petitions from various American Jewish groups, President James Buchanan refused to intervene, stating that the US should not meddle in the affairs of other independent governments.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{42497492-5B3A-48E9-B8F1-2440D3493547}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03445","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03445","objects_customfield_5":"CARVALHO, S.

Chartered on February 10, 1834, it was Baltimore's first non, \n\nsynagogal Jewish organization. Although officially a mutual aid \n\nsociety, it was in reality a charitable organization.  It also had, as \n\nwas to be expected, some religious overtones. The charter stated that \n\nthe organization could adopt a constitution and bylaws provided, that \n\nthe same shall not be contrary to . . . the Jewish Rites. . . .  The \n\ncharter gave as the reason for the formation of the organization the \n\nlaudable purpose of affording relief to each other, and their respective \n\nfamilies, in the event of sickness, distress or death. \n\n\n\nAmong the most active members of the society were Jacob Ezekiel \n\nand Levy Collmus (or Kollmus).

Levy Collmus, the society's \n\ntreasurer, an immigrant from Prague, settled in Baltimore in 1800. A \n\ntraveling merchant (a euphemism for peddler), Collmus married \n\nin 1812 a Quaker girl, Frances Williams. In spite of his marriage \n\noutside the faith, he continued to be active in Jewish affairs.

The collection houses about 15 letters written to his nephew and seven penned by Leeser to his uncle.\n\n\n\nIn this 1/15/1833 one page letter from Baltimore, Maryland he writes to both Isaac Leeser and his brother Jacob (age 23-24) who is no doubt with Isaac. Given the date this is probably when Jacob initially immigrated to America. Interestingly in the body of the letter Rehine addresses Jacob in the third person, he probably had never seen Jacob as Rehine would have been in the USA when he was born. Rehine encourages him to learn English I hope he will get well acquainted in the English language, and there will be no doubt he will do well in this Country. Rehine goes on to encourage his good behavior so that he will do well in business; additionally it speaks of contacts that might be made for young Jacob Leeser. \n\n\n\nTHIS ADVICE IS TIMELESS! The letter gives rare insight into the strength of extended family relationships in the progression of an early Jewish immigrants.\n\n\n\nLeeser's younger brother Jacob died of smallpox at the age of twenty-five in 1834, one year after immigrating to America.  Jacob contracted the disease from his brother Isaac after coming to Philadelphia to care for him. While surviving the disease and the trauma of his brother's death, Leeser' face remained deeply pock-marked, a disfigurement that would cause him great embarrassment throughout his life. Both Jacob and Isaac died bachelors.\n\n\n\nJacob Leeser correspondence are rare, there is only one in this Collection and none at the ASHS, AJA or at U of P. It is know that much of Leeser's personal family correspondence was destroyed at his death.\n\n\n\nIsaac was the second of three children; his one older sister was named Leah Lippman and his younger brother was named Jacob Lippman. Leah married a butcher named Hirsch Elkus who moved the family to the small town of Denekamp, Holland located near the Dutch-German border.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{44988B97-49DA-43BB-9C1B-55FB57FD5B35}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03707","objects_customfield_6":"THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OF PHILADELPHIA BY WHITEMAN.","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / REHINE, ZALMA /  Lippman, JACOB","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"1/15/1833","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Zalma Rehine in Baltimore to both his nephews, Isaac and Jacob Leeser, in Philadelphia.

This is an important association piece to the First Family.\n\n\n\nCol. Washington was the sixth son of George Washington's older half brother, Augustine. He was commissioned a captain in the 3rd Virginia Regiment Feb. 1776, wounded at Trenton Dec. 1776, and received his majority Jan. 1777. Promoted to lieutenant colonel Nov. 1778. Wounded again at Cowpers and taken prisoner at Eutaw Springs, 1781. Became a brigadier general 1798, honorably discharged June 1800. A Charles Wilson Peale portrait of Col. Washington is at Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nHe clearly has a developed business relationship with WAW. The letter discusses moneies owed WAW were Levy acted as his agent. It also speaks of the sale of shares and the price of crops. Additionally he asks if WAW still has the shares in the Potomak Canal as he has a buyer.\n\n\n\nInstitutions hold numerous commerical corespondence between WAW and George Washington. The Potomak Canal was GW's project.\n\n\n\nFew ventures were dearer to George Washington than his plan to make the Potomac River navigable as far as the Ohio River Valley. In the uncertain period after the Revolutionary War, Washington believed that better transportation and trade would draw lands west of the Allegheny Mountains into the United States and bind those people to us by a chain which never can be broken.\n\n\n\nGeorge Washington did not live to see the completion of the navigation project that had been his obsession since youth. He died in 1799, two years before the canal opened at Great Falls. But in the long run Washington's vision of a strong nation linked by trade came true. His frequent toast, Success to the navigation of the Potomac! became a footnote of American history.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Patowmack Company was a financial failure, its builders pioneered lock engineering and stimulated a wave of canal construction important to the country's development.\n\n\n\nThe Potomac Canal was the new nation's first effort to link the rich western agricultural lands with the coastal port cities of the east. Founded in 1785, and was active until it was overtaken by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in 1828. During its operation, the canal system was used to ship flour from mills in the foothills of Appalachia to the tidewater of the Chesapeake, where the flour was transshipped to the Caribbean as trade for sugar and other goods. This trade soon became the basis of agricultural wealth in West Virginia's eastern panhandle and throughout the Appalachian Piedmont. Coal was also shipped via the canal system from the upper reaches of the Potomac River to workshops at Harpers Ferry and beyond. This industrial trade route laid the foundation for what would eventually become the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{934E2164-EEA1-4F2D-BA78-771CF1026E73}","objects_refno":"2008.06.27.00003","objects_customfield_6":"Biograhical Dictionary of Early American Jews by Rosenbloom","objects_customfield_5":"Levy, Jacob Franks","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"2/22/1796","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"A letter from Jacob Franks Levy, son of Benjamin Levy, to William Augustine Washington (1757-1810), nephew of George Washington, in Westmoreland County, Virginia.

The B&O was chartered in 1827, and construction on the main line began the next year. The first tickets for passenger excursions were sold in 1829, and the twenty-one kilometer (thirteen-mile) line from Baltimore to Ellicott Mills opened in 1830. Regular service was provided using horses for motive power, but by 1831, steam locomotives took over passenger trains, and horses were completely eliminated from freight service within the next few years. The Baltimore & Ohio was the first common carrier railroad chartered in the United States. It wasn't the first in the world; that accolade belongs to the Stockton & Darlington and Manchester & Liverpool, both English, in 1825. The B&O sent its first engineers and financiers across the Atlantic to inspect and learn from these pioneer railways to learn the latest technology. The railroad was conceived as a means to capture western trade for the port of Baltimore. \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{6505C9BA-8794-4682-A07F-D94DC880ED11}","objects_refno":"2009.06.02.00001","objects_customfield_6":"AN AMER.

The most substantial of these merchants apparently was Benjamin Levy, probably the same mentioned in the Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society (i. 21). \n\n\n\nIn the list of stockholders of the Bank of Baltimore, published at the end of 1796, appear the following names: Solomon, Kitty, Reuben, Shinah, and Hetty Etting; Jacob F., Philadelphia, Benjamin, and Hetty Levy; and Levy and Myer Solomon. Worthy of note is that four stockholders are women. It is a conservative estimate, to put the Jewish population of Baltimore in 1796 at fifteen families.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{B1E1B626-B878-49A6-81AC-6E60FB6C2D28}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04014","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04014","objects_customfield_5":"LEVY, HETTY (1761-1816)","objects_objtype":"STOCK","objects_date":"6/30/1798","objects_coltype":"MONETARY","descript_1":"Three Bank of Baltimore stock certificates, made out to Hetty Levy, the daughter of Benjamin Levy, one of the founders of the Bank of Baltimore","person_nam":"Levy, Hetty","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Levy, Hetty","location":"Baltimore, MD","date":"1798-06-30T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder A","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"30a-30b","tiff_locat":"lbr_fa_s30a_1r.tif; lbr_fa_s30a_1v.tif; lbr_fa_s30b_1r.tif; lbr_fa_s30b_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.612188,39.29038]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":169,"longitude":-76.61218816,"latitude":39.29037976,"ref_1":"ref3495","ref_2":"cid4638564","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Official documents","descriptio":"Cohen Jr., Jacob I.

Since his mother died at his birth, he was reared by an aunt in England. He was well educated and became proficient in English, French, Spanish, German, and Hebrew. His father, a Jewish Jamaican coffee grower and exporter, moved to Philadelphia, where he became president of Congregation Mikveh Israel in 1820. Jacob joined his father in Philadelphia, and there he married Rebecca Sterling about 1826 and learned the printing trade. His ancestors had supported themselves as printers for generations, beginning in the sixteenth century, when a De Cordova in Spain published ��lvar N�_��ez Cabeza de Vaca's explorations in Texas. In 1834 Jacob moved back to Kingston, where he and his brother Joshua started a newspaper, the Kingston Daily Gleaner, which continued for more than 150 years. In early 1836 Jacob went to New Orleans, where he shipped cargoes of staples to Texas during its struggle for independence. At this time he served a term as Grand Master of the Odd Fellows. After the battle of San Jacinto he visited the Republic of Texas to install members in the Odd Fellows lodges, the first established outside the United States. He settled in Texas in 1839 and lived in Galveston and later Houston, where he was elected a state representative to the Second Texas Legislature in 1847. He served for one term but lost the election in 1849. De Cordova traveled extensively through Texas, including the frontier western areas. Through scrip and direct purchase he acquired large amounts of land to sell to settlers; at one time he had a million acres in scrip or title. To attract settlers to Texas, he made speeches on Texas in New York, Philadelphia, and other cities, and even to the cotton-spinners association in Manchester, England. His lectures were published on both sides of the Atlantic and were widely read. His land agency, which he owned with his half-brother Phineas De Cordova,qv became one of the largest such agencies that ever operated in the Southwest. De Cordova and two other men laid out the town of Waco in 1848-49. Town lots of an acre sold for five dollars, and nearby farmland brought two to three dollars an acre. At the urging of his wife, De Cordova reserved free sites for schools, churches, and commons.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{418BC36B-1990-4271-81BF-87BB97E4817E}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03136","objects_customfield_6":"JEWS OF TEXAS","objects_customfield_5":"DE CORDOVA, JACOB","objects_objtype":"DEED","objects_date":"10/4/1865","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Land grant signed by Jacob De Cordova, as attorney for Richard Kimball","person_nam":"De Cordova, Jacob","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"De Cordova, Jacob","location":"Bosque County, TX","date":"1865-10-04T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"TX 621","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_tx_621_1r.tif; doc_ja_tx_621_1v.tif; doc_ja_tx_621_2r.tif; doc_ja_tx_621_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.059766,42.358428]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":219,"longitude":-71.05976637,"latitude":42.35842801,"ref_1":"ref370","ref_2":"cid4641670","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"Cushman Bros. & Co.

THANKING; HIM FOR A COPY OF HIS BOOK...PROBABLY AN ARCTIC BOAT JOURNEY; PUBLISHED..1860. WILL WAIT ON NOTE UNTIL HE GETS RETURN ON BOOK; A SURGEON IN THE SECOND GRINNEL ARCTIC EXPEDITION (1853.55);\n\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century as an ambitious young country expanded its horizons westward, Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes, a young physician from an Orthodox Quaker family in the rural farmland of Pennsylvania, turned his eyes to the North. As a member of the harrowing American arctic expedition under the command of Dr. Elisha Kent Kane in search of the lost British explorer Sir John Franklin, Hayes became obsessed with making his own mark in the far northern polar regions. He organized his own privately funded voyage to the Arctic in 1860, during which he claimed to have reached a farthest north and to have stood on the edge of the fabled Open Polar Sea, a mythical ice-free zone in the high northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nThrough his own hard fought experiences, combined with the knowledge learned from native Greenlanders or Polar Eskimos, he successfully influenced the course of Arctic discovery, causing perceptive explorers to follow his guidance and lead. Directing the same ambition to humanitarian and social causes, during the devastating U.S. Civil War and as an elected politician in New York State during its Gilded Age, Hayes served the public good for a decade, with accomplishments as far reaching as his Arctic service, but little recognized even during his lifetime. In this book, which draws upon Hayes family papers, the little viewed diaries from Hayes s own expeditions, as well as other unpublished primary sources, the story emerges of a remarkable but forgotten explorer, writer, politician, and humanitarian who epitomized the rugged and restless spirit of adventure and individualism of 19th-century America.

K. Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina. In December 1824, led by Isaac Harby, forty-seven Charleston Jews petitioned the leaders of Beth Elohim for major changes in the Shabbat service. At that time, Beth Elohim followed the Spanish and Portuguese minhag (customary ritual), which the leadership saw as the service used by observant Jews since the time of the Second Temple. The dissidents asked that each Hebrew prayer in the service be immediately followed by an English translation; that new prayers reflecting contemporary American life be added; that the rabbi offer a weekly sermon - in English - that would explain the Scriptures and apply them to everyday life; and that services be shortened.\n\n\n\nDescended from a Sephardic family that had fled Spain for Portugal then Morocco, London and Jamaica before moving to Charleston in 1782, Isaac Harby was an unlikely Reformer. Harby_��s father Solomon married Rebecca Moses, the daughter of one of South Carolina's leading Jewish families. Born in 1788, Isaac became a noted teacher, playwright, literary critic, journalist and newspaper editor.\n\n\n\nHarby demonstrated little interest in religion in his younger years, but in the early 1820s he became alarmed by organized Protestant efforts to convert American Jews and the emergence of anti-Semitism in politics. Harby wanted his fellow Charleston Jews to defend Judaism from its critics and themselves from proselytizers, but worried that they knew too little about their religion, were ill-tutored in Hebrew or other languages, could not understand the traditional Spanish and Portuguese rituals at Beth Elohim and were thus defenseless against the Protestant challenge.\n\n\n\nHarby and his fellow reformers thought that services at Beth Elohim had to become more American -- frankly, more like services those in surrounding Protestant churches. They wished to worship no longer, as they put it, as slaves of bigotry and priest craft, but as part of the enlightened world. The leaders of Beth Elohim refused to consider their petition, citing the congregation's constitution, which required that at least two-thirds of the membership join in any call to amend synagogue rituals or practices. In response, the reformers created an independent Reformed Society of Israelites for Promoting True Principles of Judaism According to Its Purity and Spirit.\n\n\n\nMeeting at a separate site, the Reformed Society of Israelites wrote its own prayer book, introduced music into the service and worshipped without head coverings. Harby became an active leader of the Society, serving as orator and, in 1827, as president. On the first anniversary of the reform petition, he delivered a lengthy and eloquent address explaining the Society's goals, which he circulated widely as a pamphlet. Though understandably the pamphlet received a mixed reception within the Jewish community, many non-Jewish readers praised it. Even octogenarian Thomas Jefferson wrote to say that he found the reforms proposed entirely reasonable, though confessing that he was little acquainted with the liturgy of the Jews or their mode of worship.\n\n\n\nWhile the Reformed Society of Israelites flourished for a few years, the leaders and loyal members of Beth Elohim never ceased their relentless criticism and ostracism of the reformers, and many members became discouraged as their families split apart on religious grounds. Harby left Charleston for New York in 1827, profoundly affected by the premature death of his wife that year (Harby himself died suddenly in 1828). Other reform leaders either died or drifted away. Although the Society never officially disbanded, it ceased to exist sometime after the mid-1830's. Most members rejoined KKBE. However, the spirit of reform in Charleston did not die with Harby.\n\n\n\nThe influences on Charleston_��s reformers were clearly native, not imported from Germany. They sincerely believed that Judaism in America could not survive if it could not modernize to combat conversion. The traditionalists argued, in turn, that such a watered-down Judaism was itself assimilated bend recognition. The debate between American reformers and traditionalists begun in Charleston in 1824 continues.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2F1E670F-C0A3-4E15-98A3-EDB47795C440}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03606","objects_customfield_6":"Singerman  415 this is the only copy","objects_customfield_5":"HARBY, ISAAC / CARVALHO, D.M./ MOISE, ABRAHAM / COHEN, E.P.","objects_objtype":"Broadside","objects_date":"5/17/1825","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Broadside transmitting the constitution of the Reformed Society of Israelites, with the printed signatures of Isaac Harby, D.M.

The date is December 7, 1869. Sheriff Mackey in turn assigns a portion of the bond to Hannah Enston, dated December 7, 1869. Hannah Enston was the wealthy widow of William Enston, a furniture maker, merchant and steamship owner who had died in 1860 leaving her an estate of $1,000,000. She ran her own businesses. Enston is perhaps best known for his bequeathing money to Charleston to build a retirement community. \n\nMackey signs the document [see] It's witnessed by S.P. Mousseau. On the same day Mackey assigns a smaller part to James E. Walker. Mackey signs again. Edmund William McGregor Mackey (1846-1884) was born in Charleston and in 1865 [age 19] was appointed assistant assessor of Internal Revenue in South Carolina.

He was Sheriff of Charleston County 1868-1872 [time of this document] and alderman of the city of Charleston 1868, 1873, 1875. He was editor of the Charleston Republican 1871-1872, member of the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1873. He presented his credentials as an Independent Repubulican elect ot the 44th Congress and served from March 4, 1875-July 19, 1876 when the seat was declared vacant. He attended the 1876 and 1880 Republican National conventions and served as Assistant US Attorney for South Carolina 1878-1881. He unsuccessfully challenged the election of Michael P. O'Connor to 46th Congress but successfully challenged O'Connor to the 47th Congress and served from 1882-1884. [see picture from internet]. Walker reassigns his interest to Stephen Thomas, March 18, 1870. Its witnessed by G.M.

Jacob Rosenfeld, the Hazan of the Congregation Shearit Israel of Charleston and the Rev. Abraham De Sola, Hazan of Montreal. Mr. De Sola was the only one of the candidates who had been at Philadelphia to read the service and deliver a sermon during the late absence of Mr. Leeser....none were appointed.\n\n\n\nHe was elected Hazan of Shearit Israel in Charleston, South Carolina on 6/1/1851 and left in 1853.

De La Motto came from a distinguished American family and served as a surgeon in the War of 1812. He received his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nThe letter gives a firsthand account of the dispute at Beth Elohim that caused him to lead a group of Congregants from Beth Elohim to form a new Orthodox congregation, Shearith Israel. This letter is circa Fall of 1840 since it mentions both Mr. Nathan Hart and H. M. Hertz who both died shortly after the July 26, 1840  Organ meeting. Unfortunately the letter is incomplete; the three and a quarter pages are the last portion of the letter with the signature page.\n\n\n\nLeeser was not happy with De la Motta; he wanted the matter taken to Court and not have the synagogue broken apart. When Leeser wrote Jacob's obituary in the Occident 4/1845 his praise was scant....When the unfortunate separation took place_�_ Dr. De La Motta was made president of the so-called orthodox party_�_ We are not going to praise or censure him for the part of non-interference which he took latterly.. no doubt he gave offence to those who had acted with and under him_�_ But now he has gone to a place of rest, where contention and strife are unknown, and where he will be judged by his Maker according to his deeds.\n\n\n\n BACKGROUND of the Dispute_�_..The issue of introducing organ music into Sabbath and festival services was discussed at a general meeting of the Beth Elohim congregation held on July 26, 1840 and attended by ninety members. In the course of the heated discussion on this issue, a resolution was introduced and passed inviting Poznanski to come to the meeting and give his opinion on this matter.\n\n \n\nHe accepted the invitation and confirmed his view that an organ would be beneficial, quoting from some authorities in an attempt to bolster the idea that such an addition would not be contrary to Jewish law. Despite the attempts of the chair, Nathan Hart, to declare the resolution calling for the introduction of an organ out of order, it was passed by a vote of 46 to 40. \n\n \n\n The traditional members of KKBE were stunned by the outcome. They maintained that a vote of 46 to 40 did not fulfill the synagogue's constitutional requirement that any ritual alteration required a three-fourths majority of members present at a meeting. None of this helped, and beginning in 1841 an organ was used during Sabbath and festival services.\n\n\n\nIt is known that Isaac Leeser [prominent Philadelphia chazzan] advised Nathan Hart, the President, to take out an injunction against the majority, but he did not do so. Also, although the minority had threatened that they would take the matter to court, it happened that two of their leaders, Nathan Hart and H. M. Hertz, died shortly after the organ meeting and, feeling that an appeal to the law would have been repugnant to them, they decided instead to retire from Beth Elohim. They organized another congregation called Shearith Israel (using the same name as the Sephardic congregation in New York City) and erected a building on Wentworth Street, near Anson, a few blocks away from Beth Elohim.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe reformers were now in control of KKBE, and it was not long before other changes were introduced. Emboldened by their control of the congregation and Board, the Reform group began to make and suggest a number of other changes such as the modification of the Maimonidean creed and various traditional prayers and hymns, to the extent that the more moderate Reformers within Beth Elohim, although satisfied with the organ, became alarmed that things might go too far. Peacemakers managed to work out an uneasy compromise, but much more was still to come. \n\n \n\n. \n\n\n\n On the first day of Passover, 1843, the Reverend Poznanski delivered a sermon advocating the discontinuance of the second day of the Holy Days, which aroused further strong opposition. A special meeting of the Board of Trustees was held on April 19, 1843, which wrote the Hazan asking him to inform it if in the future he would continue to advocate innovations of the established forms of service as observed by us and all the congregations of Jews throughout the world. The Board contended that his suggestion was a violation of the Constitution and calculated to create discord and anarchy.\n\n \n\n Poznanski replied that he had been authorized by a former Board of Trustees to make such remarks and observations as I deem proper and that the majority of those who now disapproved of his sermon had previously well known his opinions on the subject in question. He concluded that since lecturing was not a part of his original duty anyway, he would discontinue all lectures and would also discontinue reading prayers in English, and confine himself to Hebrew, the performance of which only devolves on me as your Hazan.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe synagogue membership now split into two groups - those who supported Poznanski and his reforms and those against them. Those opposed proposed a resolution that would require synagogue services to follow all Mosaic and rabbinic Laws. It failed by a close vote of 27 to 24. The traditionalist group proceeded to invite the former members of KKBE who had formed Congregation Shearith Israel at the time of the introduction of the organ to rejoin KKBE. (They would later claim these individuals had temporarily withdrawn but never actually resigned their membership.) In this way they would end up with a majority of members who favored traditional religious services. \n\n  \n\n\n\nThirty-four former members agreed to rejoin provided certain religious conditions were met. One was that religious services be conducted as they had been before the introduction of the organ. A second was that KKBE build a Mikveh. The third was that no chazzan be elected or allowed to officiate who expressed or advocated reform doctrines. This led to a good deal of wrangling, with the reform group attempting to keep those who wanted to rejoin from becoming members and the traditionalists agitating for their admission as members in good standing. At a meeting in May 1843 the traditionalists granted membership rights to thirty-two members of Shearith Israel. The reformers, of course, claimed the vote was invalid. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe issue was brought to the Charleston Court of Common Pleas by the reform group. This court, as well as a court of appeals to which the case was later brought, decided in favor of the reform group, ruling invalid the membership of those from Shearith Israel. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAnd so ended the legal aspects of the court ease, with the parties involved still in direct opposition about the basic philosophy and pattern of Judaism in regard to change and reform. Nor did the contestants accept the suggestion of Judge Butler [who wrote the majority appeals court decision] to concede somewhat to each other. The Shearith Israel members remained with Shearith Israel, joined now by some of the Traditionalists of Beth Elohim.

The decision resulted in the formation of a new congregation by the more traditional members, known as Shearith Israel, which, however, reunited with the old congregation in 1866.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{A7384726-E9C5-4016-A76C-1DC59BF477FC}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03556","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03556","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / LAVSANO, JOSHUA","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"4/10/1849","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Joshua Lavsano in Charleston, South Carolina to Isaac Leeser.

Wayne received this plantation for service to the revolution. He was never out of debt and eventually lost it.\n\n\n\nCohen was a merchant in Savannah and fought in the Revolutionary War. He is no doubt acting as an intermediary to the Dutch. Philip Jacob Cohen along with Mordecai Sheftall, Levi Sheftall, Philip Minis, and Sheftall Sheftall were in the first days of the Revolution disqualified by the authorities from holding any office of trust in the province because of the pronounced revolutionary ideas which they advocated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Revolutionary war hero, Wayne was often called ���Mad Anthony��� because of his courage on the battlefield. He fought in numerous important battles during 1775-78 and demonstrated his military excellence in his surprise attack on and capture of Stony Point in 1779. In 1780 his quick action prevented a British seizure of West Point after Benedict Arnold���s betrayal of the post. In 1783, General Wayne retired from active military service. In gratitude for his part in subduing the hostile Indians in Georgia, the state of Georgia gave him an 800-acre rice plantation. He borrowed the necessary capital to work it from Dutch creditors, who subsequently foreclosed on the land. \n\n\n\nWayne was from Pennsylvania and was a member of the Pennsylvania council of censors in 1783, where he favored a new constitutional convention being called. He was a representative of Chester County to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1784 and 1785, and in 1787, he supported the new federal Constitution at the convention in Philadelphia. After serving as a member from Georgia of the U. S. House of Representatives, Wayne was appointed major general by President George Washington in order to pacify the Indians of the Ohio Valley. He defeated the Indians at the battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, obtaining their complete submission and surrender with the Treaty of Greenville in August 1795.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{51646797-F841-47F8-91F9-AC24238927B7}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02692","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02692","objects_customfield_5":"WAYNE, MAD ANTHONY /  COHEN, PHILIP JACOB ( .1790)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"9/28/1785","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Letter by Gen.

Moses (1783-1857) like his father served as deputy sheriff in 1822 and was active in the Jewish community. Also like his father he was an active slave trader.\n\n\n\nThe mystery of this historically important document is how did Solomon Moses Jr. know Junius Brutus &  Mary Ann Booth well enough that their son was delivered in the Moses's home? They had recently come from England in 1821. This is the famous Booth acting family, it had been said they were Jewish but with no proof, but friend of Jews as this document proves.\n\n \n\nJunius Brutus Booth (May 1, 1796 - November 30, 1852) was an English actor. He was the father of John Wilkes Booth (the assassin of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln), Edwin Booth (an exceptional actor in his own right), and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr., an actor and theatre manager. Junius was born in St. Pancras, London, England, the son of Richard Booth, a lawyer, and Jane Elizabeth Game, and grandson of John Booth, a silversmith, and Elizabeth Wilkes, a relative of the English radical and politician John Wilkes\n\n\n\nHe displayed remarkable talent from an early age, deciding on a career in the theatre by the age of seventeen. He performed roles in several small theatres throughout England, and joined a tour of the Low Countries in 1814, returning the following year to make his London debut. Early in 1815, Junius met Marie Christine Adelaide Delannoy while boarding at her mother's home in Brussels. They eloped, marrying in London on May 18, 1815. Their first child, Amelia, was born October 5 of the same year, but died in infancy. Their only child to survive infancy, Richard Junius Booth, was born January 21, 1819. \n\n\n\nBooth gained national renown with his performance in the title role of Richard III in 1817 at the Covent Garden Theatre. Critics compared his performances favorably with those of Edmund Kean, who was at that time the foremost tragedian in Britain. Indeed, partisans of these two actors would occasionally start rows at venues where the two were playing together. This did not however stop the two from performing in the same plays; Kean and Booth acted in several Shakespearian productions at the Drury Lane Theatre from 1817 to 1821. In 1821,\n\n\n\nBooth ran off to the United States with Mary Ann Holmes, a flower girl, abandoning his wife and their young son. Booth and Mary Ann claimed to be married that year[1] and settled near Bel Air, Maryland in a farmhouse which Booth later remodeled and named Tudor Hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. \n\n\n\nHe then embarked upon a thirty-year acting career that made him famous throughout the country. Booth traveled to such cities as Baltimore, Boston and New York; he was particularly acclaimed in New Orleans for his ability to perform in French. During this time, his family, which grew to 10 children, lived in great isolation in primitive conditions, despite the grand name they gave to their residence. \n\n\n\nIn 1825-1826 and 1836-1837 Booth made tours of his native England without his family. By 1831 he had become the manager of the Adelphi Theatre in Baltimore. His acclaim continued to grow throughout the rest of his life; Walt Whitman described him as the grandest historian of modern times. Although his relationship with Mary Ann was relatively happy, they lost four children, three in the same year (1833), and he suffered from a combination of alcoholism and madness. His health declined steadily through his later years, and he became known as Crazy Booth, the mad tragedian. It was often difficult for his friends to tell whether he was drunk or crazy. In 1846, his first wife learned of her husband's second family and left England for the United States. After years of unsuccessful attempts to break up his relationship with Mary Ann Holmes, she divorced him in 1851. On May 10, 1851, with the youngest of their ten children now eleven years of age, Junius finally legally married Mary Ann. In 1852, he was involved in a tour of California with his sons Edwin Booth and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr., performing in San Francisco and Sacramento.

Felsenthal and Herman Eliassof. \n\n\n\nThis first synagogue of K. A. M., and the first Jewish house of worship in the State of Illinois, was dedicated on Friday, June 13, 1851. The auditorium was crowded to excess. The most influential citizens of Chicago were present, and several co-religionists traveled hundreds of miles in order to participate in the consecration. Rev. S. M. Isaacs of New York was the minister invited to deliver the dedicatory sermon.\n\n\n\n All the city papers teemed with paragraphs laudatory of his address. We quote from the Daily Democrat' s report of the dedication: \n\n \n\n\n\nNo person that has made up his mind to be prejudiced against the Jews ought to have heard such a sermon preached. It was very captivating, and contained as much of real religion as any sermon we have ever heard preached. We never could have believed that one of these old Jews we have heard denounced so much could have taught so much liberality towards other denominations. The sermon was appropriate and eloquent, and was preached from the text: They shall make unto me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them. The Jewish ladies cannot be beaten in decorating a place of worship. The flowers, leaves and bushes were woven into the most beautiful drapery that Chicago ever saw before. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{40D55404-5AFC-47C8-86C3-51CB1CBF2710}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03618","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03618","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / Unknown","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"6/18/1851 Not dated but references concecration on","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from an unknown gentleman to Isaac Leeser.

Joseph Jonas, an English Jew, arrived from Philadelphia o March 8, 1817, was the first Jew to settle in the area west of the Allegheny Mountains A watchmaker and silversmith by trade, Jonas had heard that the Ohio River valley offered many opportunities. This is a well written letter replete with gems. His disdain for the recent arrivals is evident; there are notes of assistance to fellow Jews in the Great Pittsburgh Fire and a great plea to dumb down the Occident.\n\n\n\nThis is a fine content letter from a Jewish American pioneer. Jonas speaks with a low regard for the recent German Jewish immigrants _�_. with respect to the Institute which we are endeavoring to establish here, I am afraid it will come to nothing, for our Brethren here as you correctly state are indeed 'rude and uneducated,' and are also tainted with infidelity, bigotry and superstition_�_. them being more willing to receive assistance than to assist or lend their support to either of the two Congregations..but at the same time must give them credit for being Charitable; for calls of that nature are indeed numerous; as a specimen, upwards of $500 was collected from them & the societies for the suffering at the Pittsburg[sic!] fire.\n\n\n\nHe makes a plead to dumb down the Occident for the rabble!!!!... Your Occident is calculated for the Rich and educated Jew, not for the poor and illiterate Sons of Israel, who only know that they are Jews. they want something to warm them up as patriots in a national point of view, as well as to stir up their zeal in our holy Religion;--we are not as in Europe writing with this word of Persecution at our throats;--being on an equality with the Gentile, we are required to be strong & courageous; and altho' few in numbers against the Midianitish[?] Camp, to sound our 'Trumpets' break our 'Pitches,' and Proclaim aloud The Sword of the Lord/ and of Gideon.\n\n\n\nSo father Joseph Jonas history_�_ Joseph wrote letters describing the opportunities that existed in the Ohio River valley. This convinced other Jews to join him including two younger brothers, Abraham and Edward. By 1824 there were enough Jewish residents to fulfill the requirement of ten adult males so that regular religious services could be held, and the first Jewish congregation beyond the Allegheny Mountains was established. Of the seventeen original members of Congregation B'nai Israel (Sons of Israel), three were the Jonas brothers. Abraham and Joseph must have been impressive figures because they were able to marry the Seixas sisters, Lucy, age eighteen, and Rachel, age twenty-two. They were the daughters of the first rabbi born in America, Gershom Mendes Seixas. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{143EB26E-C65A-45C8-B929-3B226D2991B9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03758","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03758","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / ABRAHAM, LEWIS /JONAS, JOSEPH","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"9/4/1845 and 9/6/1845","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Two letters written to Isaac Leeser on one sheet.

After discussing this matter, the attendees were informed that Nefutzoth Yehudah, the Portuguese congregation in New Orleans was planning to set up a statue of Judah Touro cast in bronze and set up in the outer courtyard of the Portuguese synagogue. The next day, Benjamin II went to speak with Mr. J. K. Gutheim, the preacher and chazzan of the Portuguese synagogue, who was strongly in favor of erecting the monument. He pointed out that erecting such a statue was forbidden by halacha, but Gutheim would not change his mind. Benjamin II realized that he had no recourse but to register a public protest, so he published his views on the matter in the Cornerstone, a periodical read by most in New Orleans. . An article attacking him soon appeared. Benjamin II, fearing for his safety, soon left New Orleans for Cincinnati. \n\n\n\nThis matter was picked up by a number of national publications, including Isaac Leeser���s Occident. Disappointed by the failure of his project, Gutheim withdrew his congregations��� pledged $900 support of Benjamin���s international Jewish welfare organization, and attempted to smear Benjamin in the press. His actions in the media were considered deplorable by leaders of Reform Judaism in Cincinnati, and those leaders also ruled that erecting the statue appeared to violate Jewish tradition according to their interpretations of Jewish standards (at that time).\n\n\n\nMuch of this theological controversy, has been preserved in Benjamin���s Drei Jahre in Amerika���\n\n","thing_uuid":"{0B7CE713-5AC1-4683-A721-8AB772EDBECC}","objects_refno":"2010.09.23.00005","objects_customfield_6":"2010.09.23.00005","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / Benjamin II ( Israel Joseph Benjamin)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"1/1/1860 (sometime in 1860)","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter fragment from Benjamin II (Israel Joseph Benjamin) to Isaac Leeser.

Wise_�__�_.3/1/1850\n\n\n\nIn spite of their past differences (over a lengthy period) Isaac Leeser invited Isaac Wise to contribute a series of articles for the Occident (thought by many to have been foolhardy) and bound to lead to conflict and misunderstanding. Believed to have been justified by Leeser because of his personal feeling of regret for some of the things he had written about Wise in 1850. Wise then wrote for Leeser's Occident a series of five articles entitled PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM which ran in sequence in Winter-Spring 1851 issues.\n\n\n\nHere, in Isaac Wise's own very neat penned hand are four lengthy (8 x 12 �_) pages of the third article of that series_�_and in the original authentic hand of Leeser are editorial corrections to that article in the wide right-hand margin. Leeser has personally penned, in his easily recognizable, tiny, distinct hand editorial notes and corrections to that article and has even inscribed the title of the article at the top margin of the first page PRINCIPLES OF JUDAISM / No. III.  \n\n\n\nImmediately following in the distinctive hand of Isaac Wise: TO THE EDITOR OF THE OCCIDENT / REVEREND SIR!  Since you have been kind enough to insert my letters in your magazine I continue to write on my subject without any farther [sic] introduction or excuse; please to recollect that we have stated in my last [article] that Judaism rests upon four strong and immovable pillars [which he enumerates_�_] and then proceeds at great length for the four pages to set forth his views.  Pages 2, 3 and 4 heavily interspersed with neatly and boldly hand lettered phrases and short passages in Hebrew.  (In attempting to lay down the fundamentals of Judaism from the Reform point of view, this and the attendant articles of the series prove to be the germ of his future work The Essence of Judaism which Wise published in 1861.)\n\n\n\nThis is an important piece of American Judaica relative to the very practice of the religion and directly related to the two most important 19'th century personalities in American Jewish life.\n\n\n\nAlthough four lengthy pages, this letter was likely longer and contained Wise's signature, which are lacking. However there is absolutely no doubt as to the authenticity. Numerous letters by Wise are in the Collection for a clear authentification. Including the marginal and editorial notes by Isaac Leeser (which includes a lengthy one _�_There is an error in Dr. W's formula here_�_ and describes why he is taking exception to population figures that Wise quoted in his article).\n\n\n\nSketch on Wise's Career:      During his lifetime Wise was regarded as the most prominent Reform Jew of his time in the United States. His genius for organization was of a very high order; and he was masterful, rich in resources, and possessed of an inflexible will. More than of any of his contemporaries, it may be said of him that he left the impress of his personality upon the development of Reform Judaism in the United States.\n\n\n\nWise emigrated to the United States in 1846. He arrived in New York on July 23, and in October was appointed rabbi of the Congregation Beth-El of Albany. He soon began agitating for reforms in the service, and his was the first Jewish congregation in the United States to introduce family pews in the synagogue. A mixed choir, and confirmation were also among the innovations introduced by Wise, who even went so far as to count women in forming a minyan or religious quorum  \n\n\n\nAs early as 1848 Wise issued a call to the ministers and other Israelites of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. His call appeared in the columns of the Occident, and was ably seconded by its editor, Isaac Leeser. Wise suggested that a meeting be held in the spring of 1849 at Philadelphia, to establish a union of the congregations of the entire country. This meeting did not take place; but the originator of the idea never ceased advocating it, especially after he had established his own newspaper, The Israelite (July 1854, restyled The American Israelite July 1874), in the columns of which he tirelessly expounded his views upon the subject. His persistence won its reward when in 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati. \n\n\n\n1850 September 7, (1 Tishrei 5611 Rosh Hashana) , while Isaac Mayer Wise was serving as Rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Albany New York, he asserted in an address to a reform congregation that he did not believe in the coming of the Messiah nor the resurrection of the dead. Members of the Albany synagogue demanded that he be fired, he refused and forcefully ascended the pulpit. A fistfight broke out which included Wise and the synagogue president. The police had to intervene and close the synagogue.\n\n\n\nThis caused a split in the Albany community, and the consequent formation of a new congregation, the Anshe Emeth, by the friends and supporters of Wise. Wise remained with this congregation until April, 1854, when he became rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun congregation of the Lodge Street Synagogue of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he officiated for the remaining forty-six years of his life. Wise was above all an organizer, and called numerous institutions into being. He organized the building of the Plum Street Temple in 1866. The temple, noted for its architectural grandeur, was renamed the Isaac M. Wise Temple in his honor.\n\n\n\nHe was indefatigable in insisting upon the pressing need of a theological seminary for the training of rabbis for American pulpits. His indomitable perseverance was crowned with success when, on October 3, 1875, the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students, four of whom were ordained eight years later.\n\n\n\nHe lived to see the establishment of the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889, which was the third enduring offspring of his tireless energy and unfailing perseverance. During the last eleven years of his life he served as president of the conference which he had called into existence \n\n","thing_uuid":"{EE801325-D226-4016-A2F3-BAF9F75DF668}","objects_refno":"2007.04.19.00006","objects_customfield_6":"2007.04.19.00006","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC /  WISE, ISAAC MAYER  (1819-1900)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"1/1/1851","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Rabbi Issac Mayer Wise to Isaac Leeser","person_nam":"Leeser, Isaac","person_n_1":"Wise, Isaac Mayer","corporatio":"","merger":"Wise, Isaac Mayer | Leeser, Isaac","location":"Cincinnati, OH","date":"1851-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Leeser","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"Ohio","tiff_locat":"leeser_20_807_001.tif; leeser_20_807_002_and_003.tif; leeser_20_807_004.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.456887,39.161997]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":426,"longitude":-84.45688654,"latitude":39.16199715,"ref_1":"ref2862","ref_2":"cid4639192","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Letter  ASD re: funds","thing_uuid":"{7AEBACD7-E63D-45BA-A583-8576FD9CF190}","objects_refno":"2007.08.01.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2007.08.01.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Mendel, Isidor / Rosenberger, Simon / Wildberg, Simon","objects_objtype":"LETTER / ILLUSTRATED LETTER HEAD","objects_date":"7/17/1884","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Signed letter regarding funds","person_nam":"Mendel, Isidor","person_n_1":"Rosenberger, Simon","corporatio":"","merger":"Rosenberger, Simon | Mendel, Isidor","location":"Cincinnati, OH","date":"1884-07-17T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"OH 730","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_oh_730_1r.tif; doc_bhl_oh_730_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.456887,39.161997]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":427,"longitude":-84.45688654,"latitude":39.16199715,"ref_1":"ref2888","ref_2":"cid4639166","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Two page letter, 5/8/1878, is written to Rabbi Sabato Morais of Mikveh Israel, Philadelphia by Jacob Ezekiel, Secretary of Hebrew Union College.

(The position of Hassan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post.

(The position of Hassan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post.

His genius for organization was of a very high order; and he was masterful, rich in resources, and possessed of an inflexible will. More than of any of his contemporaries, it may be said of him that he left the impress of his personality upon the development of Reform Judaism in the United States.\n\n\n\nWise emigrated to the United States in 1846. He arrived in New York on July 23, and in October was appointed rabbi of the Congregation Beth-El of Albany. He soon began agitating for reforms in the service, and his was the first Jewish congregation in the United States to introduce family pews in the synagogue. A mixed choir, and confirmation were also among the innovations introduced by Wise, who even went so far as to count women in forming a minyan or religious quorum\n\n\n\nAs early as 1848 Wise issued a call to the ministers and other Israelites of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. His call appeared in the columns of the Occident, and was ably seconded by its editor, Isaac Leeser. Wise suggested that a meeting be held in the spring of 1849 at Philadelphia, to establish a union of the congregations of the entire country. This meeting did not take place; but the originator of the idea never ceased advocating it, especially after he had established his own newspaper, The Israelite (July 1854, restyled The American Israelite July 1874), in the columns of which he tirelessly expounded his views upon the subject. His persistence won its reward when in 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati.\n\n\n\nIn 1850, a fistfight between Wise and the synagogue's president caused a split in the Albany community, and the consequent formation of a new congregation, the Anshe Emeth, by the friends and supporters of Wise. Wise remained with this congregation until April, 1854, when he became rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun congregation of the Lodge Street Synagogue of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he officiated for the remaining forty-six years of his life. Wise was above all an organizer, and called numerous institutions into being. He organized the building of the Plum Street Temple in 1866. The temple, noted for its architectural grandeur, was renamed the Isaac M. Wise Temple in his honor.\n\n\n\nHe was indefatigable in insisting upon the pressing need of a theological seminary for the training of rabbis for American pulpits. His indomitable perseverance was crowned with success when, on October 3, 1875, the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students, four of whom were ordained eight years later.\n\n\n\nHe lived to see the establishment of the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889, which was the third enduring offspring of his tireless energy and unfailing perseverance. During the last eleven years of his life he served as president of the conference which he had called into existence\n\n","thing_uuid":"{AF35B98B-F4D2-4745-A971-F9B26BAC1C77}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00385","objects_customfield_6":"Singerman not listed","objects_customfield_5":"WISE, ISAAC MAYER (1819.1900)","objects_objtype":"BROADSIDE & LETTER","objects_date":"1/1/1854","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Prospectus of The Israelite","person_nam":"Wise, Isaac Mayer","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Wise, Isaac Mayer","location":"Cincinnati, OH","date":"1854-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"OH 443","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_oh_443_1r.tif; doc_ja_oh_443_1v.tif; doc_ja_oh_443_2r.tif; doc_ja_oh_443_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.456887,39.161997]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":430,"longitude":-84.45688654,"latitude":39.16199715,"ref_1":"ref3113","ref_2":"cid4638944","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Miscellaneous","descriptio":"This is the unique Charter of The Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society of K.

By 1850, the need for a new house of worship was apparent and the congregation purchased the old Musical Association Hall, a building that could accommodate 300 worshipers. The congregation had outgrown the Musical Association Hall almost as soon as they moved into it. On March 11, 1853 they dedicated their Jackson Street Synagogue. The building had been built as a Unitarian church in 1846. Baruch Emanuel gave up leading the congregation in early 1853, before services had been held in the new building. Rabbi Emanuel remained active in the community; in 1859 he was a trustee of Mobile Hebrew Relief Society.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{AC6B1FCD-45D1-4DF3-9E1E-708692A90E79}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03787","objects_customfield_6":"THE GATES OF HEAVEN PG 38 / JEWS OF MOBILE ALABAMA, PG. 58","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC  / EMANUEL, B.M.","objects_objtype":"LETTER/STAMPLESS","objects_date":"5/14/1857","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from B.M.

Perhaps no man in Clarion borough has been more closely connected with the material prosperity and advancement of the place than the subject of this sketch. Born on the 18th day of November, 1832, in the village of Neckar Binau, Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany, of Jewish parents, where he resided until his twentieth year. At the age of fourteen years he taught a private school, and at sixteen a public school in his native place. This early training in the educational work no doubt infused into him that spirit of vigor in working for the advancement of the public schools of the borough which he has always shown, and that so frequently has received the recognition of his fellow-citizens.\n\n\n\nIn his twentieth year he emigrated to the United States, arriving at Pittsburgh in August, 1852. He remained in that vicinity until 1853, when he settled in Clarion. In November of that year he started a clothing store on Main street, where he continued in the business until the war, when he engaged in general merchandising, to which he added a lumber yard in 1865, and in 1879 still further expanded his already extensive business. by adding tobacco and cigars at wholesale, supplying many of the merchants of this. and surrounding counties with these articles. Indeed it has long been a common saying that there is nothing he cannot sell you, nor is there anything that he will not buy. In 1854 he joined Clarion Lodge I. O. O. F., and in 1856 the Masonic Lodge. In both of these lodges he still retains an active membership, having been frequently elected to offices of honor and trust in both. At present he is, and has been for fifteen years, secretary of the Masonic Lodge and treasurer of the lodge of Odd Fellows.\n\n\n\nHe has been connected with the First National Bank of Clarion since its organization in 1865, as one of its directors, and for years its vice-president. He has been the president of the Clarion County Mutual Fire Insurance Company since 1875, and also president or director of the Clarion Water Company since its organization in 1875. He is a stockholder in the Natural Gaslight and Heat Company, and in the Agricultural Association, being treasurer of the latter company. He was the only agent for the different express. companies that transacted business at Clarion until 1884, when the P. and W. Railroad Company went into the express business itself and refused to carry for other companies. He has been an acting member of the school board for a number of years, and has frequently served as a member of the town council. He is usually court interpreter in causes where witnesses are able to use only the German language, and attorney in fact for the majority of those here having business to transact in Germany, or for those there having personal or business interests here.\n\n\n\nAlthough a very busy man, Charley Kaufman, as he is familiarly known throughout the county, is always ready to do a favor or accommodate a friend or customer. He has made his adopted country completely his own, and has never been found wanting by voice or deed in any public enterprise or good work. His large family has been brought up in accordance with the spirit of American free institutions, and with the customs of the land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{8A11FD3C-1BCB-4558-B379-A31D2811B47A}","objects_refno":"2010.03.30.00001","objects_customfield_6":"History of Clarion County, Pennsylvania  EDITED BY: A.

Carr (January 1867) from Columbia, South Carolina to Rev. Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was written shortly after the Civil War. It is a fine account of a smaller Southern Community's struggle to re-establish Orthodox Judaism after the ravages of the War. She thanks Leeser for visit to the school, inserts details about officers. Importantly notes the monetary help from Charlotte, Philadelphia. and Baltimore. Speaks of the hard times. Details the attempt; to revive Judaism on strict orthodox principals with a rented temple/shocate/sunday; school. She lists the officers of the Congregation (all men) and Sunday school (all women). I believe from the style of the letter that L. Carr is female, as a note S. Carr is of the Vice President of the Congregation, \n\n\n\nThis part of the letter speaks of Leeser's efforts��_. When first we (Leeser) met to Meditate upon a mode of action/ How to rescue from oblivion the tottering and smouldering[sic!] pillow of/ our ancient edifice we felt like Columbus when venturing out with/ his devoted little [?](Crew) in 1492 upon the turbulent and/ unchartered mighty Atlantic. Many have pronounced it a Bold plan. And/ though not as successful as him in making the voyage in two months/ yet thank God the cry is Sand-A-Hoy and our devoted little bark/ strugling[sic!] through the foaming billows Has heard the Haven of our long/ anticipated desires and cast her anchor in gentle and placid waters/ where the light of Heaven reflects a benign blessing around those/ gathered under the Shadow of her wide expanded sails unfurled to the/ breeze. Though our means and circumstances in life have been reduced/ by the casualties and ravages of war yet with the help of Kind Heaven/ and the assistance of a few of our coreligionists we have been/ enabled to procure the services of a Chasan and Shackel and Rented/ a place of worship where old and young can assemble to Praise/ Israels God. We have also a Sunday School annexed to our Congregation/ for the instruction of the Children of our Holy faith [crossed-out: and] an Institution��_..We had the pleasure of a visit from the Nestor of American Ministers/ Rev Isaak Leeser on the 10th inst and the gratification to listen/ to words of wisdom and instruction from his gifted and fluent lips/ and the vivid lightning flashes of his Brilliant and Prolific mind./ The meeting was well attended and the decorum and order observed/ at the same showed that his instruction made a deep impression upon/ the minds of his hearers and were relished\n\n","thing_uuid":"{BF33B49C-FC33-4D36-A3CB-69B11277D438}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03706","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03706","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / CARR, L.

Straus, United States Ambassador to Turkey written in 10/11/1899 is to Dr. Kayserling (This is the World famous Jewish scholar..see write up below). It is historically important as it speaks to his plan to resign his Ambassador's position. It is written on a confidential basis..on United States legation letter head.  \n\n\n\nOscar Solomon Straus (1850 -1926) was United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1909. Straus was the first Jewish United States Cabinet Secretary.\n\n\n\nHe was born in Otterberg, Germany. He emigrated with his parents to the United States, and settled in Talbotton, Georgia. At the close of the Civil War he moved to New York City where he graduated from Columbia College in 1871 and Columbia Law School in 1873. He practiced law until 1881, and then became a merchant, retaining his interest in literature.[1] He first served as United States Minister to the Ottoman Empire from 1887 to 1889 and again from 1898 to 1899. He left the Commerce Department in 1909 when William Howard Taft became president and became U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire until 1910. In 1912, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York on the Progressive and Independence League tickets.\n\n\n\nRabbi Dr. MEYER KAYSERLING, ...German rabbi and historian; born in Hanover June 17, 1829; died at Budapest, April 21, 1905; educated at Halberstadt, Nikolsburg (Moravia), Prague, W�_rzburg, and Berlin. He devoted himself to history and philosophy. Encouraged in historical researches by Leopold von Ranke, Kayserling turned his attention to the history and literature of the Jews of the Pyrenean peninsula. In 1861 the Aargau government appointed him rabbi of the Swiss Jews, which office he held until 1870.

This historically important letter describes his childhood art training in England. It is the only first hand source that validates Cohen's early training.\n\n\n\nCohen the first Jewish artist in the Midwest came from Canada to Detroit in 1836. He was born and trained in England. His early life is shrouded in mystery. This important letter related an incident in his training while in his early teens. It also names the school. Up until this letter little was known of his early life, possibly his background could now be researched through this letter.\n\n\n\nBritish-born Frederick Cohen came to Detroit from Woodstock, Canada in 1837 and established himself as a prominent portrait painter, Michigan's first Jewish artist.  Handsome, genial and witty, Cohen billed himself as a portrait, miniature, historical and scriptural painter, and enjoyed promenading about town in a brass-buttoned, blue swallow-tailed coat, a buff waistcoat, and a high, white beaver hat.  Although considered something of a dandy, Cohen was nobody's fool.  Once, a prominent Detroit mason contractor and his daughter, dissatisfied with Cohen's portraits of them, returned the paintings and refused to pay.  Cohen thereupon painted asses' ears on the man's head and a beard on the daughter's face and hung the portraits in the post office.  Shortly thereafter the contractor paid his bill.  \n\n\n\nApart from portraits, Cohen decorated panels for lake passenger steamers, an art form much appreciated by the traveling public of that day.

It was received when he was sixteen. Of note it was found among his papers in America. Accompanying the letter is an English translation (likely rendered c. 1930's or 1940's and now tattered at its bottom) clearly indicating that it is addressed ISAAC LEESER.)\n\n\n\nIn the classic work Isaac Leeser and the Making of an American Judaism by L.J. Sussman (1995) is describes Leeser's life in those early teenage years in Dulmen and his association with Rabbi Katz (Cohen) and the lasting impression made upon him who considered Leeser his star pupil [giving him] an honored seat in his classroom.\n\n\n\nLetter opens: your teacher Rabbi Benjamin Katz [Cohen] is happy to receive your letter and the Testament. All are happy about it. If you have money enough to buy a Testament, please do it. Money well spent will be well worth it. We are going to [looks like Ulenbrutz] on Sunday. All the children in Cheder [Hebrew school] send you their hearty greetings. We are all happy about your letter.

He came from New York City to serve in 1846-48 as chazan of the Easton synagogue.  After serving as chazan, he stayed on in Easton as a merchant, and ultimately became President of the congregation. As such, he became the principal leader of the Jewish Reform movement in Easton. In 1859 or soon after that, he returned to New York with his family. Both of his sons became lawyers in New York, and one became a Judge.\n\nOn August 26, 1839, Congregation Brith Sholom (Covenant of Peace) was founded. Solomon Rotha and Michael Lederer were the prime movers in the work of creation. Membership was predominantly of German origin; records and sermons were in German until the end of the century. The first officiating Rabbi was Rev. Manis Cohn, succeeded by Rev. Mr. Gling and the 3rd was Rev. Mr. Putzel. The congregation rented quarters for religious worship on the south side of Spring Garden Street, between Third and Bank Streets. On November 24, 1842, we were chartered as the Congregation Brith Solomon and built a Temple on South Sixth Street in that year. Its fa�_ade was that of the great Synagogue in Florence, Italy. The Temple is the third oldest in Pennsylvania and the oldest outside of Philadelphia. It is the tenth oldest in the United States. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{8E107ABE-F395-4EC6-85CB-09AF1D9C6AA0}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03584","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03584","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC /  PUTZEL, MICHAEL","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"5/2/1848","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A group of three letters from Michael Putzel to Isaac Leeser.

Mordecai Myers dated, City of Washington 18th May 1813, sent to him while he was at Fort Niagara, 13th Reg. Inf. from Robert Brent the first Mayor of Washington DC, and signed by Robert Brent This letter was received by Capt Myers shortly before the battle of Fort George which took place May 25 1813. War of 1812 letters with are Jewish connection are rare.\n\n\n\nThe letter is in regards to money due the United States that Capt Myer owes or has been reimbursed for recruiting expenses. It has a fair level of detail. I am not sure why The Mayor of Washington is involved with this war payment. This letter came out of a group of Capt Myers Papers compiles by Capt Myers Son and related to Capt Elliott and The Battle of Lake Erie.  Capt Mordecai Myers was involved in a trial or investigation of this famous naval battle. I am not sure of Capt Myers connection to Lake Erie Battle.  I think the red ink is in the hand of Capt Myers son. The size is 8 X 10. \n\n\n\nThere is also a stampless cover that held the above letter to Capt. Mordecai Myers. It is post Washington 19 May 1813, sent to Capt Myers at Fort Niagrara, 13th Reg. Inf. and signed by Robert Brent who was the first Mayor of Washington DC. The cover also has a light FREE stamp. There is another post mark that looks to be Jun 13th but I am not sure of the mark. This cover was received by Capt Myers shortly before or after the battle of Fort George which took place May 25 1813. The cover is addressed Capt Myers at a New York address but forwarded to him at Niagara. The size is 8 X 10 open and 5 1/2 X 3 1/4 with a hole an some stains.\n\n\n\nMordecai Myers was born in Newport, R. I., in 1776, the son of Loyalists. His father was a learned Hungarian Jew who may have been known as Myer Benjamin. Young Mordecai grew up in New York City where, it would seem, he made his living as a merchant or auctioneer. He was active in the Spanish-Portuguese synagogue, Shearith Israel, served as one of its trustees in the first decade of the nineteenth century. \n\n\n\nHe joined the military company under the command of Colonel John Marshall, who was to become the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. After his tour of duty in the army, he went to New York to try again operating a retail store, which also turned out to be a failure. He then tumed to politics, where he achieved success. He became a member of Tammany, which was a political group fighting the old conservative Federalist Party in New York. This political machine managed to break the strangle-hold of the Federalists and Myers started politically moving up the ladder. \n\n\n\nWhile he was engaged with his newfound political life, Myers studied military tactics for two years. He joined an artillery company un- der the command of Captain John Swarthout and, later, he was commissioned as an officer in the infantry. When the War of 1812 started, Mordecai Myers was commissioned a captain in the 13th Pennsylvania Infantry. Captain Myers became a hero when he saved more than two hundred men and their military supplies.  As he wrote to his friend, Naphtali Phillips, then the editor of what Myers facetiously termed a kasher newspaper: Sum must spill there blud and others there ink. Myers belonged to the former category, for he almost died of wounds received in the Battle of Chrysler's Field, on November 11, 1813. He recovered from his wounds and became involved in politics in New York City. He was elected to the New York State Assembly and then decided to move to Schenectady, where he became the city's first Jewish mayor. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{6116B981-7903-4B4C-937A-6161E859FD4D}","objects_refno":"2010.12.04.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.12.04.00001","objects_customfield_5":"MYERS, MORDECAI CAPTAIN (1776.1871)","objects_objtype":"Letter and Stampless Envelope","objects_date":"5/18/1813","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"Letter connected to War of 1812 to Captain Mordecai Myers from Robert Brent, the first Mayor of Washington DC regarding money owed and expenses","person_nam":"Myers, Mordecai","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Myers, Mordecai","location":"Fort Niagara, NY","date":"1813-05-18T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Revolutionary War","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"32","tiff_locat":"doc_rw_32_1r.tif; doc_rw_32_1v.tif; doc_rw_33_1r.tif; doc_rw_33_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-91.384868,40.397268]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":666,"longitude":-91.38486776,"latitude":40.39726803,"ref_1":"ref2839","ref_2":"cid4639215","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Lowitz.

Mordecai Myers by Lieutenant H Dayo from a Camp near Fort Niagara, New York and received by Lieutenant Joseph Eldridge of the 13th U.S. infantry during the War of 1812. The letter was signed by Lieutenant H Dayo and Lieutenant Eldridge with no letter date but received by Lieutenant Eldridge May 22nd 1813. It is intriguing because of the complicity of a pending duel of two US officers, Lieutenant Eldridge KIA by Canadian Indian and the additional fact that Capt. Mordecai Myers is arguably the most famous Jewish solider of the war of 1812. \n\n\n\nThe letter is in regards to a duel that was to take place between Capt. Mordecai Myers and Lieutenant H Dayo. The duel was brought about by Capt Myers calling Lt Dayo a coward which brought on the challenge. The duel needed to be delayed because of the pending attack of Fort George in which the two of them were involved. Lieutenant Eldridge was acting as Capt. Myers Adjutant when he received this letter and was killed not long after this letter was received, it is signed by Eldridge. Lieutenant Eldridge died at the hands of Blackbird's warriors who apparently scalped in him during the fight for Fort George.\n\n\n\n Address Side: Lt. Eldridge   Private _�_.Letter reads as best as I can discern as follows: Camp near Fort Niagara_�_ Sir, Your note is received.  I stand ready to meet the gentleman and two different times appointed. On his part Once on his return and Once at the rock previous to our as the matter had been thus delayed it is thought improbable to be carried into Effect at this period being on the verge of battle, it in my opinion would be considered _______. I don't consider myself bound to notice it any farther for the present. H. Dayo\n\n\n\n\n\n  This letter is a companion to three highly important and possibly unique group of three letters relating to a duel that were placed in the Collection five years ago. Those letters are as follows_�_ (1) Lt. Henry Deyo challenges Myers, his superior officer to a duel 4/15/1813 letter (2) In a signed letter , Myers accepts the challenge 4/16/1813 and in (3) a signed letter in Myers hand, he spells out the terms of the duel 5/13/1813. (See lot 20.762) Five years after this lot was purchased a fourth letter, described above, dated 5/23/1813 was located and placed in the Collection. After this letter nothing more is known other than about one week later Lt. Henry Deyo resigns and leaves the Army...did he lose his nerve?\n\n","thing_uuid":"{428CC193-E3F9-48C6-B163-32491A2E2033}","objects_refno":"2010.12.02.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.12.02.00001","objects_customfield_5":"MYERS, MORDECAI CAPTAIN (1776.1871)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"4/23/1813","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"Letter to Captain Mordecai Myers from Lieutenant H Dayo regarding the duel that was to take place between Captain Mordecai Myers and Lieutenant H Dayo","person_nam":"Myers, Mordecai","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Myers, Mordecai","location":"Fort Niagara, NY","date":"1813-04-23T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Revolutionary War","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"31","tiff_locat":"doc_rw_30_1r.tif; doc_rw_30_1v.tif; doc_rw_31_1r.tif; doc_rw_31_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.128857,41.130599]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":538,"longitude":-85.12885691,"latitude":41.13059946,"ref_1":"ref1319","ref_2":"cid4640726","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"GREAT LITHO OF POLAR BEAR & STORE FRONT; PRICE LIST IN MIMIO FORM; 92.98 EAST COLUMBIA ST.; ;","thing_uuid":"{EF2F8AB0-CA0B-4227-BC03-5733DBF22210}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01343","objects_customfield_6":"THE JEWS OF SAN FRANCISCO, 1849.1919 BY COGAN","objects_customfield_5":"WEIL BROS.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"1/1/1885","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Weil Brothers","merger":"Weil Brothers","location":"Fort Wayne, IN","date":"1885-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"IL 220-221","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_il_221_1r.tif; doc_bhl_il_221_1v.tif; doc_bhl_il_220_1r.tif; doc_bhl_il_220_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.128857,41.130599]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":539,"longitude":-85.12885691,"latitude":41.13059946,"ref_1":"ref1573","ref_2":"cid4640474","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Broadsides","descriptio":"Weil Bros. & Co.

He died in a accident about one year before, 5/28/1782.\n\n\n\nThis document is a land transfer where Benjamin Conklin has sold to Joseph Sargeant, Jr. a tract of land bordering on the estate of Aaron Lopez.....signed at bottom by Benjamin Conklin, Lucretia Conklin, Austin Flint, John Southgate and on the back by Hezekiah Ward and Nathaniel Baldwin.\n\n\n\nAaron Lopez was born in Portugal in 1731. His family was Jewish, but outwardly professed Christianity because of the continuous persecutions of the Inquisition, and he was baptized under the name of Duarte Lopez. Between 1748 and 1750, most of the Aaron's family settled in Newport, Rhode Island, known for religious tolerance. Aaron, his wife and his daughter joined them in 1752. \n\n\n\nOver the next twenty years, Aaron was a major force in making Newport both the leading Jewish community in America, and also the second-largest mercantile port (after New York City). He was instrumental in founding the Touro Synagogue, the first in the colonies. He was also a pioneer in the spermaceti industry, and engaged in a wide variety of mercantile activities, including the slave trade.\n\n\n\nLopez's business was ruined by the American Revolution. Along with many Newport merchants, Lopez had somewhat of a reputation for Tory leanings. His merchant ships were preyed upon by both sides in the conflict. Furthermore, the British occupation of the town and the general devastation of the war finished Newport as a leading port city. \n\n\n\nDuring much of the war, Lopez lived in Leicester, near Worcester, Massachusetts. After the British had been driven from Newport in 1782, Lopez set out to help rebuild his home city, but never made it back; he drowned in a pond while tending to his horse on 5/28/1782.\n\n\n\nIn August, 1763, Mr. Benjamin Conklin was invited to settle as a minister over the society, and was ordained, November 23, of the same year. His relation of minister to this church and society continued till June 30,1794, when his growing bodily infirmities induced him to accept a proposal from the society for his dismission, by giving him a gratuity of Σ170, and an exemption from taxation. The society, at the time of dissolving the connexion between them, expressed to him their thanks for his useful and arduous services, and their sympathies for his declining health and increasing infirmities.\n\n\n\nHe survived until January 30, 1798, when he died, at the age of 65. A plain headstone, in the burying ground, in Leicester, bears this inscription, which he had selected for the purpose in his life time.  Hie jacet, Benjamin Conklin, M. in expectatione diei supremi. Quails erat, dies iste indicabit. He married the widow of Dr. Lawton, who had been a practicing physician in this town. He left three children, one only of whom survives. He was a native of Southold, on Long Island, and was graduated at Princeton College, in New Jersey. He came here when about thirty years of age, and was a minister of this society for more than thirty years, including the trying period of the Revolution, and the troublesome times of the insurrection, known under the name of  Shay's war. It is most conclusive evidence of his prudence and firmness, that during the whole time he officiated here, he was acceptable to his people, and every attempt by disaffected individuals to remove him was controlled and defeated by his society. Though never distinguished for brilliancy of talents, he was a respectable preacher, and ever possessed a commanding influence among bis people. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","thing_uuid":"{89F53340-B616-494D-84FB-A83F51CA8E15}","objects_refno":"2010.05.02.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.05.02.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Lopez, Aaron","objects_objtype":"DEED","objects_date":"5/3/1783","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Lopez, Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Lopez, Aaron","location":"Leicester, MA","date":"1783-05-03T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana Oversize","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"15","tiff_locat":"doc_jal_15_1r.tif; doc_jal_15_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.036109,46.59271]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":591,"longitude":-112.0361092,"latitude":46.59270976,"ref_1":"ref453","ref_2":"cid4641588","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"J.

This manuscript is an important slice in the history of an influential Jurist who was the first Jewish Federal Judge. His rulings hold importance today.\n\n\n\nThis is an Exparti Naturalization when Trieber was 34 years old. He came before a judge who deemed him a citizen since he had come to the USA as a minor, took instruction to become a citizen and had intention to do so for three years.\n\n\n\nJacob Trieber (1853-1927) of Helena (Phillips County) and Little Rock (Pulaski County) was the first Jew to serve as a federal judge in the United States. Serving from 1900 to 1927 as judge for the U.S. Circuit Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, he became known in judicial circles as a genius as lawyer and jurist. He presided over more than 1,000 cases annually, kept his docket current, and had time to serve many assignments outside his own district. He issued nationally important rulings on controversies that included antitrust cases, railroad litigation, prohibition cases, and mail fraud; some of his rulings, such as those regarding civil rights and wildlife conservation, have implications today. His broad interpretation of the constitutional guarantees of the Thirteenth Amendment, originally overturned by the post-Reconstruction U.S. Supreme Court, was validated sixty-five years later in a landmark 1968 equal opportunity case.\n\n \n\nJacob Trieber was born in 1853 in Raschkow, Prussia, to Morris Trieber and Blume Brodeck Trieber. He attended school at Ostrow (near Raschkow and Breslau-present-day Wroclaw, Poland) through the elementary level. In 1866, he moved with his family to St. Louis, Missouri, and continued his schooling. Two years later, the family moved to Helena and opened a store, where Jacob clerked. In 1873, he began studying law in the evenings under former Arkansas Supreme Court Justice Marshall L. Stephenson. He was admitted to the state bar in 1876 and formed a partnership with Stephenson's brother, L. C. Stephenson, and later with Marshall.\n\n \n\nAs his adopted home, Arkansas became dear to him, although the blatant racism he saw had a lifelong effect on his life and work. He sought to communicate-through his own life and deeds and his commitment to equal justice-that racism was detrimental to the people of Arkansas and that only until the state's race relations problem was solved could the state's great potential be achieved. He attacked Arkansas's election laws, saying they disenfranchised black voters. Certain rights are inherent in every free man, he said. He saw this as true not only for African Americans but for women, and he spoke out for women's suffrage. A woman is a person and should be entitled to all the rights guaranteed by the constitution to a male person. In a 1914 speech, he predicted that within ten years women in every state would have the right to vote.\n\n \n\nTrieber's interest in civil rights stemmed from what he had seen in Europe as a youth. He later recalled his childhood days in Prussia, remembering how the discrimination against Jews consumed the country. He said he feared any country's future that would allow such discrimination against its citizens, and he hoped Arkansas could steer a different course.\n\n \n\nHe became a member of the Republican Party in 1874, believing its policies of that day-a strong union, primacy of the U.S. Constitution, pro-business policies, greater opportunities for African Americans, and a high protective tariff-were best for the nation. He was elected to Helena's city council in 1882, named superintendent of the state census in 1890, and elected Phillips County treasurer in 1892. In 1897, he was appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas and moved to Little Rock. In 1900, President William McKinley appointed him federal judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n\n \n\nTrieber's civic legacy in Arkansas was far-reaching. He was at the forefront of varying campaigns, such as saving the Old State House from destruction, establishing the Arkansas State Tuberculosis Sanatorium in 1909, and, during World War I, serving on the Arkansas State Council of Defense and representing the state on the American Red Cross national board. He supported laws regulating alcoholic beverage traffic. In his years as a lawyer and judge, he drafted many laws that were written into the state's statute books, including the Banking Law in 1913.\n\n \n\nTrieber married Ida Schradski of Peoria, Illinois, January 10, 1882. They had two children, Harry and Bess. The family was affiliated with Congregation Beth El of Helena and, later, Congregation B'nai Israel of Little Rock-both Jewish Reform. A Mason for more than fifty years, he was elected Grand Master of the state's Grand Lodge in 1906 and served two years. \n\n\n\nBecause Arkansas's judicial system seemed unable to prevent violence and racism, Trieber used his rulings against such injustices. Two of his rulings in 1903 involved the whitecappers (groups similar to the Ku Klux Klan). United States v. Hodges dealt with fifteen whitecappers's efforts to have black workers fired at a sawmill in Poinsett County. United States v. Morris was a case involving terrorism by whitecappers in Cross County. In Hodges, Trieber instructed jurors to consider whether a person should be permitted to employ whom he pleased or whether others could compel him. In Morris, he held that the rights to lease lands and to accept employment for hire are fundamental rights, inherent in every free citizen, regardless of race or color. Three of the fifteen defendants convicted in Hodges-Reuben Hodges, William R. Clampet, and Wash McKinney-appealed Trieber's ruling (Hodges v. U.S.).In 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Hodges, reasoning that the ability to earn a living was not a fundamental right of citizens protected by the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\n \n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on Hodges led to more tragedy. Judge Gerald Heaney of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit wrote in 1985, [F]or almost fifty years _�_ the Hodges case _�_ became the rod and staff of those who denied that the federal government had the authority to intervene in race relations. It was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that comprehensive protection against racial discrimination in employment was established. In 1968, the Supreme Court overturned its 1906 ruling of Hodges in a lawsuit dealing with equal housing opportunity, Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., citing Trieber's farsighted ruling in U.S. v. Morris. Judge Trieber's interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was at last vindicated.\n\n \n\nIn a series of decisions that continue to have implications, Trieber ruled the 1913 Migratory Bird Act an unconstitutional use of federal authority, but he approved the same regulations when they were authorized by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada. An assistant U.S. attorney general represented the government at the July 9, 1914, rehearing in Jonesboro (Craighead County), which underscored the national importance of the issue after Trieber had ruled that migratory-bird hunters were not subject to federal restrictions on the basis of the constitution's interstate commerce clause. In response, the United States and Canada adopted a treaty to set hunting seasons and bag limits. Congress then adopted enabling legislation. Trieber ruled that this was a constitutional use of the federal treaty-making authority, although his decision was not the case appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal strategy of using international treaties in order for federal policy to trump state regulation has since been used to support legislation on foreign trade, drug trafficking, pollution control, endangered-species preservation, and wetlands conservation, among others.\n\n \n\nIn his twenty-seven years as a federal judge, Trieber served many assignments outside his district, one of which was the Southern District of New York. In April 1927, Judge Augustus N. Hand and Chief Justice Howard Taft invited Trieber to New York that summer. Taft also assigned Trieber to preside over a pending complex restraint-of-trade case involving the Journeymen Stone Cutters of America. After the trial started in early August, Trieber severely injured his right hand, and complications ensued. From this wound, plus being plagued with arteriosclerosis, he died September 17, 1927. His body was returned to Little Rock, and he was buried in Oakland Cemetery.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CCEA0CC8-1206-403A-81E3-5B3E336D6048}","objects_refno":"2012.02.05.00003","objects_customfield_6":"2012.02.05.00003","objects_customfield_5":"Trieber, Jacob","objects_objtype":"CITIZENSHIP PAPERS","objects_date":"5/11/1887","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Naturalization papers of Jacob Trieber","person_nam":"Trieber, Jacob","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Trieber, Jacob","location":"Helena, Phillips County, AR","date":"1887-05-11T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana Oversize","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"2","tiff_locat":"doc_jal_2_1r.tif; doc_jal_2_1v.tif; doc_jal_2_2r.tif; doc_jal_2_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.842469,40.709527]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":607,"longitude":-76.84246872,"latitude":40.70952682,"ref_1":"ref1398","ref_2":"cid4640649","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Broadsides","descriptio":"GREAT AD...

He engaged in trade with the Indians and furnished supplies to the proprietary government, and, during the war of the Revolution, to the colonial army. In 1778 Levy signed a memorial of the inhabitants of Northumberland county asking help on account of the British and Indian ravages in the vicinity.

BAERS SIGNATURE;\n\n\n\nIs this a relation of Lewis Cohen (see extensive collection...re: playing cards) who was born in in Lancaster in 1800?\n\n\n\nLewis I. Cohen, a stationer by trade, was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1800. He went to England in 1814, and he was apprenticed to his half brother, Solomon Cohen, a well-known lead pencil manufacturer in London. In 1819, he returned to the United States on the barque Mary and Susan. \n\nAs they were docking at the Burling Slip, he chanced upon a Florida schooner at the other side of the wharf, which was loaded with cedar logs. He was delighted to find such great lengths of timber and without any knots. \n\n\n\nHe promptly bought the entire shipment for 30 pounds, musing that he was paying only a fraction per log of what his brother, Solomon, was paying per foot in London. \n\n\n\nIf that were not to be indicative of the shrewdness and facility of the young man, he also managed to talk Captain Champlin of the Mary & Susan, into carting the load back with him as ballast, meaning without cost. \n\n\n\nThe days events had laid the foundation of the Cohen fortune. Lewis I. Cohen was to make a name for himself as the first American to make lead pencils. He would also become the first stationer in America to sell steel pens in place of old quills. \n\n\n\nCohen's greatest achievement and contribution to playing card manufacture would come in the form of mechanized colour printing. He was a pioneer in the field, and like many of his contemporaries (George Baxter 1836, Thomas de la Rue, 1831) came up with a very similar solution for the problem of printing four colours in one pass. In 1835 he registered a colour-printing machine that could, in one impression, press four colours. \n\n\n\nLewis I. Cohen published his first deck of playing cards in 1832 and formed his business, L. I. Cohen, New York. His insignia (the Ace of Spades) was to be an Eagle perched atop the suit symbol, enshrined by thirteen shining stars. Though, sometimes, the stars were omitted. \n\n\n\nFrom 1838 to 1844 he spent considerable sums of money enlarging his premises and expanding his enterprise, and in 1845 he issued a deck of gold embossed playing cards. That was all the Kings and Queens, and all the numbers, Cohen embossed with gold around the suit symbols and on the royal attire. Nothing says it quite like gold.\n\n\n\nIn 1850, he sold the stationery side of the business, which was now dwarfed by the card manufactory and it wasn't long before the young Mister Cohen could put his feet up and let his sons take the reigns. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{94AD1F32-12C5-4FBF-A092-2324A65F421B}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03316","objects_customfield_6":"NOT IN WOLFE","objects_customfield_5":"COHEN, LEWIS","objects_objtype":"ROLL SHEET","objects_date":"8/14/1862","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Civil War","descript_1":"The bounty roles of Captain B.

He is no doubt the most well known early Jewish Settlers of New Mexico\n\n\n\nCharles Ilfeld (1847-1929) was the seventh child of Lester and Betty Ilfeld of Homburg Vor der Hohe. In 1865, eighteen year old Charles Ilfeld arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, an old Spanish frontier town. Young Charles' arrival in the Southwest was at the most opportune time, as the Civil War had just ended and trade in the region had resumed. \n\n\n\nBy 1867, Letcher and Charles Ilfeld were already business partners in Taos. These astute businessmen perceived Las Vegas, New Mexico as their next business venture. Letcher and Ilfeld packed their merchandise on seventy-five burros and made their way to Las Vegas, where they laid the foundation for Letcher and Ilfeld, General Merchandise. Charles, in 1874, bought out Adolph Letcher's share of their business for the sum of $36,000 and established The Charles Ilfeld Company, which became one of the largest mercantile firms in New Mexico.\n\n\n\nCharles and Adele Ilfeld were active in both social and community affairs. In 1876, Charles was master of the Chapman Lodge No. 2 of the Masons in Las Vegas. He also served as director of the New Mexico Normal School, which is now known as New Mexico Highlands University. In an original 1886 document located at the Bloom Southwest Jewish Archives, we know that Charles Ilfeld was one of the distinguished organizers listed in the appeal to establish Congregation Montefiore in Las Vegas. The Bloom Archives also has the original 1886 signed document of the founding members of the Congregation Montefiore listing Charles Ilfeld as donating $150.00 for the purchase of land for building the synagogue. . As Rabbi Raphael Goldstein wrote about Charles in 1923, ... if he is the wealthiest Jew in New Mexico, he is also one of the most philanthropic. Charles was admired not only for his commercial success but also for his interests and generous support of the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of New Mexico.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{4DEAEACF-8A82-4C2A-A6A4-1ED8B7512F86}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03090","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03090","objects_customfield_5":"ILFELD, CHARLES (1847-1929)","objects_objtype":"COURT","objects_date":"8/25/1883","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Court document appointing Charles Ilfeld as city commissionery of Las Vegas, New Mexico","person_nam":"Ilfeld, Charles","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Ilfeld, Charles","location":"Las Vegas, NM","date":"1883-08-25T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NM 380","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nm_380_1r.tif; doc_ja_nm_380_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.214777,44.100349]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":706,"longitude":-70.21477735,"latitude":44.10034943,"ref_1":"ref1441","ref_2":"cid4640606","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Broadsides","descriptio":"DONE ON WRAPPING PAPER!!

It gives a commentary by Mr. Nahum Ward of Shrewsbury Massachusetts who was previously a native of the region. He visited the cave system at the invitation of Mr. Wilkins of Wilkins and Gratz who owned the cave and mined it for deposits of saltpeter and later for calcium nitrate. The saltpeter deposits were a significant contribution to the U.S. manufacture of gunpowder during the English blockade of their ports in 1812. This account appears to be one of the earliest accounts of the exploration of the cave system and includes the description of the Mummy withher apparel, jewels, musical instrument, etc. Wilkins gave the Mummy (possibly a pre-Columbian burial) and all her apparel etc to Nahum Ward, the author of this account. Mammoth Cave was discovered in the late 18th century, but only became a national sensation after Nahum Ward published an account of his 1816 visit.

The original article was printed in the Worchester Spy and then in the Boston Daily Advertiser.\n\n\n\nNahum Ward (1785-1860) was born in Shrewsbury, Mass. but in 1811 moved to Marietta, Ohio. The grandson of Revolutionary War General Artemis Ward, he was apparently well connected. He became Treasurer and the controlling shareholder of the Ohio Company of Associates, an entity established in Boston in 1786 for the purpose of investing in Ohio Lands. Later in life he served as the mayor of Marietta, founded its Unitarian Church, and had the honor of playing host to both the Marquis de Lafayette and John Quincy Adams.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was printed in Liverpool [U.K.] by E. Smith in around 1820 and under the map and mummy is printed Copied from an American Engraving dated 1817. \n\n\n\nAn American version (not in the Collection) Plan and Description of the Great and Wonderful Cave, In Warren County, Kentucky_�_. Printed [by John Low] and sold, at No. 139 Cherry-street, [New York City], [ca. 1817-21?] shows the map but not the Mummy_�_ 21.25h x 16.5w, uncolored. (It is Unrecorded. Not in Americana Exchange, American Book Prices Current, OCLC or Shaw-Shoemaker, Early American Imprints, Series II: 1801-1819). The image consists of five columns of text in small type, surmounted by the title and a large (7.25h x 12.5w) woodcut plan. The whole is surrounded a delicate border of geometric and floral elements. The text describes Ward's 19-hour journey into the cave, highlighted by the Chief City, the chamber of eternal darkness, a bat encounter of major proportions, the Pool of Clitorius, and the viewing (and apparent purchase) of the mummified remains of a native American woman. The plan is based at least in part on Ward's own observations, as he mentions carrying papers and compass and to sketching a plan of a large avenue. Though crude in execution it is quite informative, being alphabetically keyed to the main text and to a legend explaining key features of the cave. The broadside was issued as an advertisement, as a note at the base explains that The Mummy here mentioned is the same as now exhibited in Scudder's Museum in New York. After touring the country and suffering much damage and decay, the remains were donated to the American Antiquarian Society, where they were looked on with distaste by founder Isaiah Thomas. They eventually found their way to the Smithsonian Institution. \n\n\n\n\n\nDating the American broadside _�_The broadside does not name a publisher or provide a date, but reads at the base Printed and sold, at No. 139 Cherry-Street. This corresponds to the premises of printer-publisher John Low in New York City during the years 1817-1821; though it is possible he was at this location either earlier and/or later. A search of newspapers in the on-line resource America's Historical Newspapers did not yield results, but further research into the history of Scudder's Museum and its display of the Native American remains should enable one to date the broadside more precisely. Apparently this is not the only instance of Ward's account being published with a plan. For example, the October 15, 1816 Boston Intelligencer (vol. 3 no. 8) reprints a text identical to that on the broadside and illustrates it with a variant of the plan (smaller and quite different in appearance, but equally crude and apparently similar in content). It was reprinted in England in 1817 and again in 1823. It is Unrecorded. Not in Americana Exchange, American Book Prices Current, OCLC or Shaw-Shoemaker, Early American Imprints, Series II: 1801-1819. \n\n\n\nHISTORY_�_GRATZ OWNERSHIP\n\nThe connection between the names of Gratz and Wilkins in Kentucky dates back to a connection of the Eighteenth century between Michael Gratz and the father of the Wilkins brothers. It is probable that Hyman Gratz visited Kentucky before he and Charles Wilkins decided to use the Mammoth Cave. While Hyman Gratz was in partnership with his elder brother in Philadelphia, it is also probable that is when Gratz and Wilkins first begin business as merchants in Lexington. Another strong probability is that Hyman Gratz owed his first interest in the cave to his father's investigation of the Green River district, while Major William Croghan was military surveyor for Virginia.\n\n\n\nThe data of ownership from Gorin and Forwood's records of the Mammoth Cave are that McLean, the first owner, sold to Gate wood, who owned the cave until about 1811. The Gratz's next came into possession of the property. Gratz and Wilkins (Charles Wilkins, Lexington, brother of General William Wilkins, Pittsburgh) bought 1610 acres of land around and above the cave, and after using it for saltpeter-making during the War of 1812, sold to Archibald and James Miller, who had been managers for them at the cave during their ownership. Mr. Gorin states that the large quantities of saltpeter, manufactured by Gratz and Wilkins were wagonned from the Cave for shipment, principally to Philadelphia, and that after the war, the manufacture of saltpeter at the Cave was discontinued, because the resumption of imports from abroad made it impossible to compete from the West. The vats used by Gratz and Wilkins were photographed for use in various histories and guides, used by visitors to the cave. Gorin mentions the Mr. Gratz who visited the cave during the excavation which unearthed an unusually large skeleton, as being himself an unusually large man. This identifies the visitor of that occasion as Hyman Gratz. The map reprinted as the oldest map of the cave and known as the Bogert map is no doubt a copy of the working map used by Gratz and Wilkins, a copy of which substantially like the Bogert map was sent by Mr. (Hyman) Gratz to the Medical Repository. (See R. Elsworth Call, Evolution of Mammoth Cave, Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, 1896. G. P.)\n\n\n\nThe war progressed and Wilkins/Gratz used more than 70 slaves to work the leaching operation that would remove the saltpeter from the cave. To prepare for the work, square wooden vats were built and wooden pipes were made from long, straight poplar logs. The logs were then bored out with augers and then tapered so that they would fit together end to end. The slaves dug into the soil, placed the dirt into the vats and then saturated it with water that was piped in using the wooden tubes. The water trickled through the soil and the calcium nitrate leached out. The solution was then filtered through ash and boiled to concentrate the saltpeter. It was bagged and transported to mills in Philadelphia, where it was combined with powdered charcoal and sulfur to make gunpowder. The business proved to be quite profitable but after the war ended though, the price of saltpeter plummeted and the mills were able to get the product more cheaply from other locations. The operations in Mammoth Cave were closed down for good. Fortunately though, all was not lost. The fame of Mammoth Cave had started to spread. Numerous newspaper articles had been written about the cave's contribution to the war and had also discussed its natural wonders and the strange mummies that had been found in the cave. Soon, people began traveling from the east to the Kentucky wilderness and Mammoth Cave began to receive its first tourists. After Wilkins died in 1828, Gratz continued showing the cave to anyone who was interested and actually stepped up operations to make the place more profitable. He used veterans of the mining operation as guides to accompany curious travelers. Gratz as the sole owner sold his ownership in 1838.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MUMMY\n\nIn 1813 a scientific visitor, probably Mr. Merriam, of Brooklyn, N. Y., saw what he mentions as  a relic of ancient times, which requires a minute description. This description is substantially as follows: That some miners had exhumed a female body while digging saltpeter-earth in the Short Cave (not any portion of the Mammoth Cave, but a small cave in the neighborhood). The grave was covered by a flat rock, and contained the wardrobe, as well as the body of the woman. The latter was in a sitting posture, with the arms folded, and hands crossed and bound by a small cord. The inner wrapping was made of two deer-skins, closely shaved and ornamented with vines and leaves marked in white. Next came a woven sheet, in texture like fabrics made by the South Sea Islanders. The hair on the mummy's head was red and clipped within an inch of the skin. The teeth were white and perfect; the nails long; the features regular; the color dark but not black; the body free from blemish, except a wound between the ribs-and an injury to one eye; the frame that of a person about 5 feet 10 inches in height; the flesh hard and dry upon the bones; and the weight, at the time of discovery, but 14 pounds, though it gained 4 pounds more by absorbing dampness. A knapsack, a reticule, and a pair of moccasins, all of woven or knit fiber, lay by the mummy's side. The articles contained in the reticule and knapsack were head-dresses of feathers; a cap of woven bark; several hundred strings of beads tied up in bunches; a necklace of red hoofs of fawns; an eagle's claw and the jaw of a bear; folded skins of rattlesnakes; vegetable colors done up in leaves; bunches of sinews, thread, and twine; seveu needles (or awls); a deer-skin hand piece, to protect the hand in sewing; and two whistles of cane, bound together by a cord. After explaining that the cause of such perfect preservation was not due to any embalming process, but merely to the antiseptic properties of the nitrous earth, combined with the extreme dryness of the cave, this writer concludes his fanciful description, by saying, The features of this ancient member of the human family much resembled those of a tall, handsome American woman. The forehead was high, and the head well formed.\n\nThis same mummy was found by Dr. Nahum Ward, of Marietta, O., in 1815, in the Gothic Avenue (according to Mr. Proctor, a former proprietor of the hotel), and sent by him to the Antiquarian Society of Worcester, Mass., where it now is. The gentleman, to whom the credit of finding is really due, was Mr. Charles Wilkins, of Lexington, Ky., one of the owners of Mammoth Cave. In a letter dated October 2, 1817, in reply to the inquiries of the secretary of the Antiquarian Society, Mr. Wilkins first describes the mummy of an infant about one year old, found in a cave about four miles from Mammoth Cave, and which, with its clothing, had been thrown into the furnace by the workmen. He regretted this so much as to offer a reward for the next that might be found. The result was the discovery, a month later, of the one that was afterwards sent to Worcester. His agent (Mr. Miller) sent for it and placed it, for safe-keeping, in the Mammoth Cave, and quite possibly he laid it in the niche of the Gothic Avenue that is now pointed out; but this is doubted by some. Wilkins, in a matter of fact style quite in contrast with the flowing sentences of Merriam, tells the same story, confirming the account of the utensils, ornaments, and articles of dress.\n\nIn the Medical Repository (vol. xvin, p. 187), is published, a letter from Mr. Gratz, one of the owners, accompanying a parcel of curiosities sent to Dr. Mitchell, from which we may fairly conclude that, besides interlopers from Short Cave and elsewhere, there were genuine Mammoth Cave mummies. Mr. Gratz says:\n\nThere will be found in this bundle two moccasins, in the same state they were when dug out of the Mammoth Cave, about 200 yards from its mouth. Upon examination, it will be perceived that they are fabricated out of different materials; one is supposed to be a species of flag, or lily which grows in the southern parts of Kentucky; the other of the bark of some tree, probably the pawpaw. There are also, in this packet, a part of what is supposed to be a kinniconeke pouch, two meshes of a fishing net, and a piece of what we suppose to be the raw material, and of which the fishing net, the pouch and one of the moccasins are made. All of which were dug out of the Mammoth Cave, nine or ten feet under the ground; that is, below the surface or floor of the Cavern. Mr. Gratz also describes  an Indian bowl, or cup containing about a pint, cut out of wood, found also in the Cave; and adds lately there has been dug out of it the skeleton of a human body, enveloped in a matting similar to that of the pouch.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{58FFD933-B47B-439F-B3CC-B67E483D086E}","objects_refno":"2011.11.20.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2011.11.20.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Gratz, Hyman","objects_objtype":"BROADSIDE","objects_date":"1/1/1820","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Broadside for \"The wonderful Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.\" it was printed in Liverpool, UK by E.

Jacob's son Moses served in a local New York militia and then moved to Philadelphia, where he was one of the fi rst Jews to set up a home. He moved to London around 1740 (as did his brother Naphtali), most likely to serve as an agent for his father's trans-Atlantic interests. It is also thought that his mother considered New York to be too degenerate a place for her son.

This port of entry document is from Harmond Hendricks  . shipping finished copper to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n1 of 1\n\n\n\nThe Hendricks family of New York helped lay the foundation for the Industrial Revolution in America. Their pioneering production of copper was vital to the growth of the American economy and the nation's military might. When the company closed in 1938, Hendricks Brothers was the oldest continuous privately held Jewish family business in the United States.\n\n\n\nUriah Hendricks, the patriarch of the family, was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1737 and emigrated from London to New York City in 1755. In New York, he opened a dry goods store and became an active member, and eventually parnas, or president, of Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. The congregation served as the unifying institution of the New York Jewish community, which numbered about 200 people. In 1764, Hendricks established a metals business, importing copper and brass from England, which discouraged manufacture of these commodities in the American colonies. On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928. Hendricks Brothers closed its last copper mill in 1938.\n\n\n\nJust as Harmon Hendricks was able to build a business that his descendants maintained, he was able to continue a tradition of religious commitment that his father, Uriah, had bequeathed to him. Each of Harmon's children found a spouse among the families at Shearith Israel. Son Henry joined his father-in-law, Tobias I. Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz. In 1852, Henry Hendricks and eight others founded Jews' Hospital, now Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, the oldest Jewish medical institution in the United States.\n\n\n\nIsaac Leeser, editor of The Occident, the leading American Jewish newspaper of the pre-Civil War era, was often critical of what he considered the aloof and uncharitable attitudes of the Sephardic grandees. To quote Maxwell Whiteman, however, Leeser singled out the liberality of the Hendricks family as an exception ��_ Modesty and reserve continued to govern the family attitude in matters of philanthropy, and the practice of keeping such activity from the public eye, begun by Harmon Hendricks, was maintained by his descendants.\n\n\n\nIn the same low-key and generous manner, the Hendricks family descendants continue to be active in Shearith Israel and in Jewish communal life today.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{82115C74-5FE5-493B-8BBE-523A066EA2E7}","objects_refno":"2008.08.25.00031","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.25.00031","objects_customfield_5":"Hendricks , Harmond","objects_objtype":"PORT OF ENTRY","objects_date":"5/11/1826","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Port of entry document from London, England to Boston, Massachusetts for the account of Harmond Hendricks, shipping finished copper","person_nam":"Hendricks, Harmon","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Hendricks, Harmon","location":"London, England","date":"1829-06-18T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 853","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_853_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_853_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.125739,51.508528]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":730,"longitude":-0.125738904,"latitude":51.50852804,"ref_1":"ref3703","ref_2":"cid4638357","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Ports of entry","descriptio":"1 pg manuscript document,, dated Nov. 10, 1817, and signed by Robt.

He stated in his resume that he was qualified to serve as a melamed, a bal torah, a mohel, a schochet, and a bodek.  He also states that he was able to teach Hebrew, German, and English and could deliver a discourse if required.  The new Congregation could not pass up this paragon and he was hired.  Both he and the Congregation were disappointed and he left within a few months.  As a note: Upon his arrival in Macon, he consecrated the rented room, placed the Torah in the ark, and began to hold regular services in both English and Hebrew. Before his first year was completed, Rabbi Lowenthal's wife passed away, and the rabbi returned to England. In 1858 we possibly find the same man writing Leeser from in La Fayette, Indiana.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n","thing_uuid":"{EC66AC37-19B0-4E19-A02A-76597136FAD9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03770","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03770","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / LOWENTHAL, H.","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"8/17/1860","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Rev.

The documents deal with the murder of Samuel Fleishman the operator of a local general store.\n\nFleishman was a known Unionist and active Republican...early resident of St. Andrew Bay. He married the older sister of B. Altman the founder of the NYC department store.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n At the end of the war military rule gripped the South and in late 1865, former Union officer Charles Hamilton was appointed to head of the Northern district of Florida's Freedmen's Bureau. After his placement, Hamilton appointed two former Union officers, a certain W.J. Purman as head of the Jackson County office and John D. Dickinson as Justice of the Peace for Marianna, Florida. Tensions between black and whites grew as the bureau implemented its plans to reconstruct the South and by February 1869, Purman was severely wounded and a friend killed after the two were ambushed on their way home from a minstrel show. \n\n\n\nIn response to the attack, an armed mob of African-Americans assembled to ransack Marianna, but tempers cooled and all remained quiet until a group of blacks were assaulted on their way to a picnic. The attack left two of the picnickers dead and prompted random murders. \n\nDOCUMENTS\n\nThe first document, entitled: Memoranda of Occurrences relating to the assassinations in Jackson, County, 10pp. legal folio, [Marianna], October 1869, gives an eyewitness account of what Dickinson saw and heard at the start of these bloody massacres, in very small part: ...Sept. 28, 1869...Wyatt Young, Calvin Rogers...and about 23 women and children went from Marianna to Robinson Spring to attend a picnic...they were fired upon from the roadside with about 15 shots, Wyatt Young and Stewart Livingston were killed...29th as Columbus Sullivan and George Cox were hauling a load of cotton someone fired a load of shot at them, hitting Sullivan in the face and arm...Maggie McClellan [was shot in front of the hotel]...went to the hotel and found a guard there and they had three negroes in charge...one of them [a prisoner] asked me if he could be released...no one seemed to be willing to communicate with me...I saw...others all armed with guns moving...towards the park...Calvin was the guilty one...his men...ranged themselves about [me] with their guns at a ready...I went up town...and found everything in wild excitement. The young men were drunk...an evident arraignment...to let the wild boys kill Calvin...Casualties to date...Whites killed Maggie McClellan...Colored killed Wyatt Young, Stewart Livingston, Oscar Granbury...and one man unknown on Bryan's plantation...morning of the 13th...wrote to governor...recommended [?] of Election and discussed martial law business...Oct 23...Bell's house shot into...Lucy Griffin attacked three times on the street...troops arrived Oct. 26...Ely and Calhoun told Richard Pooser and other Negroes that they had got to vote...or they would make them...the Robinson Negroes would learn now that it was not best to aid in assisting a White Man...Charles Ely told Mose that a crowd had determined to kill the Nichols Girl [in retaliation for the murder of McClellan] Oct. 29th...Coker...d__d Hamilton, Purman [the agent shot in February], Lowe, and I and any man that would take an office to Out lick those fellows....\n\n\n\nAlso included is a 3pp. legal folio, Oct. 5, 1869 [Marianna], a court document in which Samuel Fleishman [a noted Unionist and an active member of the Republican party] attests before Dickinson that he was told to get out of town and that threats were made against his life. Dickinson took Fleishman's statement, but apparently was powerless to do anything about the complaints. Eventually, Fleishman was escorted to the state line by angry citizens and warned not to return, but turned up dead days later after not heeding the warning. Blame for the incident was placed on Purman and Hamilton by Florida Gov. Reed, but the killing spree did not end until a year after the two men left the county in 1870.\n\n\n\nLastly, is an A.L.S. Hamilton 4pp. 4to., Washington, Dec. 2, 1870, to Dickinson concerning their time in Marianna, in part: ...A letter comes to me as a welcome, but almost lost vice from the land of dreams...it touches a day in my memory and a cord in my heart that awakens me as if from slumber and I can't determine whether the emotion partakes more of pleasant or unpleasant...there is a people there whom I love...I think of Fleishman, that...noble, valuable friend, whom I loved with an almost holy affection.

Potter, his teacher at U. of Maryland. \n\n\n\nThere are no other copies located of this broad side.\n\n\n\nMarcus Ahlenfeld, from a German Jewish family in Bolkenheim, Silesia, studied medicine for three years in Berlin (passing his exam in surgery in 1831), and in Munich and Wurzburg (1832) for one session each. In 1832, Ahlenfeld received his degree to begin the practice of surgery. Ahlenfeld left Germany for the United States where he hoped to earn a 'fortune' practicing. He had arrived in Baltimore by mid-1833 and continued his medical study at the University of Maryland. Having passed examinations for the medical faculty of that university, Ahlenfeld was granted an MD by the Board of Trustees in 1835. His thesis was De Morbis Venereis (Venereal diseases). He became a citizen of the US in 1845. Thereafter, Ahlenfeld maintained a medical practice in Maryland and northern Virginia until his death in c.1854.\n\n\n\nHis papers are in the William L. Clements Library at The University of Michigan. This collection consists mainly of correspondence written to or for Ahlenfeld. includes a large number of letters of recommendation written by friends and professional acquaintances in Germany and the United States, a few letters from patients (or the families of patients), and a few letters dealing with personal or non-medical business affairs; including testimonials for a case brought against Ahlenfeld in Gettysburg (Pa.), in which he was accused of appearing in that town several years previously under an assumed identity. The collection also includes some notes made in medical school, several lengthy manuscripts in German and Hebrew on medicine; and approximately 12 letters in Hebrew.\n\n\n\nHis ledger in Yiddish sold in the early 1990's at Riba Auction\n\n","thing_uuid":"{DE1991E9-F5CB-4EC5-9EA6-54E4F42FE695}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03353","objects_customfield_6":"William L.

E. Levy re: land in Levy County. It was written from Miconopy, Florida.  A pioneer Jewish settler of Florida, he came in 1821. He was a visionary exponent of Jewish colonization and educational schemes. Signed documents by this famous pioneer are scarce.\n\n\n\nBorn in Morocco in 1781, Moses E. Levy was the son of a Moroccan government minister. After the Sultan's death in 1790, Morocco experienced an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence and the Levy family fled to Gibraltar. There, at the age of 15, while praying at a synagogue, Levy had a revelation, he later wrote, surpassing the idea of hellfire A according to historian Chris Monaco, During this episode . . . Moses Levy 'swore never to doubt the Bible.' While most of 19th-century American Jewry took a lax approach to religious observance, Levy remained staunchly traditional, keeping the Sabbath and observing kashrut. In 1800, the death of Levy's father and a yellow fever epidemic forced Moses, his mother and his infant sister to leave Gibraltar for the Danish Virgin Islands, where they joined a thriving Jewish community. Three years later, at age 22, he became partners in a lumber business with Philip Benjamin, father of U.S. Senator and Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. Levy subsequently moved to Puerto Rico, where he became a munitions contractor and, after separating from his wife, moved to Cuba, where he built a fortune in shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in Cuba, Levy decided to use his wealth to purchase a tract of land near Micopany in Spanish Florida, which was soon ceded to the United States. Levy built houses and dug wells in hopes of attracting European Jews living under oppressive conditions. Jews in the Diaspora needed a homeland, he observed, because no amelioration can be expected at the hands of nations for us. He argued, The race of Jews has miraculously been continued unmixed with the people of the nations through which they have been scattered and warned that every Jew who contributes to the . . . amalgamation of the House of Israel is an enemy to his nation, his religion and, consequently, to the world at large. He named his colony Pilgrimage Plantation. Between 1820 and 1824, Levy traveled north to New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk to seek financial support for his plan. Yet, by 1825, few Jews had emigrated from Europe to the wilds of Levy's experimental plantation. Perhaps the fact that hostile Indians, snakes and alligators inhabited Florida discouraged settlers.\n\n\n\nIn 1825, Levy traveled to London, hoping to persuade Jewish philanthropists there to support Pilgrimage Plantation. His pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. Through his willingness to address leading English Christians, however, Levy had an impact on the campaign to reestablish full Jewish rights in England. In 1826, a number of upper-class Christian Londoners took a genuine interest, on liberal grounds, in restoring full political equality to England's Jews, whose rights had been suspended 500 years earlier. Levy addressed reform-minded Christian groups on a number of occasions and impressed them with his learning. The sophisticated yet pious Levy helped dispel the notion among affluent Londoners that all Jews were peddlers living in poverty in London's East End.\n\n\n\nLevy also confronted the evangelical London Society for the Promotion of Christianity among the Jews, challenging their attempts to save the Jewish people through conversion. Ironically, Levy's contacts with evangelicals, whom he opposed on conversion, gave him a voice in the British antislavery movement. Levy had lived with slavery in the Caribbean and Florida. He was listened to with rapt attention on the subject by the leading group of British evangelical abolitionists was known as the Clapham Sect. Because Levy observed the Sabbath, spoke fluent Hebrew and knew the Bible, the Claphamites respected Levy as a lineal descendant of the ancient Hebrews, whose religion, they believed, was the wellspring of Christianity. British abolitionists advocated for immediate emancipation to save the souls of both slave and slave owner. Levy argued that, first, banks and businesses would have to be created to invest in non-slave agriculture and the children of slaves would have to be educated in agricultural techniques. Levy thought it would require a generation of gradual preparation for emancipation. Despite these reservations, Levy was one of the few individuals living in the American South to propose emancipation -even if he was in the relative safety of London when he made his views public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIronically, little that Levy stood for survived his own lifetime. In 1835, Pilgrimage Plantation was burned during the Second Seminole War. Levy's son, David Levy Yulee, later became a United States Senator from Florida, the first Jewish-born American so elected. Contrary to his father, the younger Levy remained pro-slavery and rejected his Jewish identity. Nevertheless, Moses Elias Levy proved a visionary in predicting that, one day, Florida would make an excellent home for Diaspora Jews to settle in.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CB81FE0C-10BA-4A3E-96E6-AD90ED8BBB14}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02615","objects_customfield_6":"NUMEROUS","objects_customfield_5":"LEVY, MOSES ELIAS (1782.1854)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"2/14/1853","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"A signed one page commercial letter written by Moses Elias Levy (1782-1854) in Miconopy, Florida, regarding land in Levy County.

Originating from a large renown family of Rabbis and scholars, De Sola was recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodox Judaism in the United States during the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\n\n\nIn 1846, De Sola was elected minister of the Shearith Israel congregation of Montreal, Canada, and he arrived in that city early in 1847. In 1848, De Sola was appointed lecturer, and in 1853 professor, of Hebrew and Oriental literature at McGill University, Montreal, and he eventually became the senior professor of its faculty of arts. He was president of the Natural History Society for several years, and addressed its members frequently on those branches of scientific investigation which came within its province. The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him in 1858 by McGill University. This was the first instance of a Jew attaining that honor in an English-speaking country.\n\n\n\nIn 1873, by invitation of President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, De Sola opened the United States Congress with prayer. The event was of significance, as De Sola was a British subject, and this was the first indication of a more friendly feeling between the United States and Great Britain after the dangerously strained relations that had been caused by the recently adjusted Alabama Claims. Mr. Gladstone, then premier, as well as Sir Edward Thornton, the British ambassador at Washington, extended the thanks of the British government to De Sola.\n\n\n\nAbraham de Sola frequently visited the United States, and, through his pulpit addresses and numerous contributions to the press, became recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodoxy, at a time when the struggle between the Orthodox and Reform wings of the community was at an acute stage. He was intimately associated with Isaac Leeser, Samuel Myer Isaacs, Bernhard Illowy, J. J. Lyons, and other upholders of Jewish tradition, and on the death of Isaac Leeser was invited to become successor to his pulpit; but this and many similar offers he declined. For twenty years he was a constant contributor to Leeser's Occident, and after the latter's death he purchased the copyrights and stereotype plates of his works and continued their publication.

Solomons was one of the most facinating American/Canadian commercial figures..\n\n\n\n\nLevy Solomons was living in the Province of New York as early as 1755. During the Seven Years' War he entered a partnership with Ezekiel Solomons, Chapman Abraham, Benjamin Lyon, and Gershom Levy to supply the British army. After the fall of New France in 1760 the consortium became involved in the Canadian fur trade, and since under British rule the settlement of Jews in Quebec was legal, Solomons eventually moved his headquarters from Albany to Montreal. The partners had financial support in England and were connected with Hayman Levy of New York City, who was active in the fur trade of the Hudson Valley. With such good backing they were able to do business on a larger scale than was usual in the trade at the time.\n\n\n\nEzekiel Solomons took a load of trade goods to Michilimackinac (Mackinaw City, Michigan) in 1761, preceding even the British troops who arrived in September to take over the post from its acting commandant Charles Michel de Langlade. Levy Solomons was at Fort Niagara (near Youngstown, New York) in 1762. During the Indian uprising of 1763 four of the partners, including Levy Solomons, were captured and large quantities of goods taken from them. All eventually reached safety but they were ruined financially. Attempts to get government compensation failed, and some of their creditors refused to agree to their declaring bankruptcy. The partnership broke up but the members continued to be involved in the fur trade. Levy Solomons had licences for seven canoes in 1771 with a total value of probably over Σ3,000. He also acted as a fur buyer, purchasing from independent traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolomons signed a petition in 1773 requesting a legislative assembly for Quebec. When the Americans captured Montreal in 1775 he cooperated with them, providing supplies to the troops and establishing three hospitals. Large quantities of his goods destined for the fur trade were appropriated by the invaders. After the Americans were driven out Solomons remained but was in great disfavour. The British turned him out of his house and threatened those who helped him. He survived, however, and remained in business until 1782. In 1784, still in Montreal, he unsuccessfully petitioned Congress to reimburse him for his losses.\n\n\n\nIn December 1768 Levy and Ezekiel Solomons (His cousin) were among the founders of the Shearith Israel congregation in Montreal. Levy Solomons was apparently lay leader of the congregation in 1782 and appeared as the defendant that year when the reader, Jacob Raphael Cohen, went to the courts to collect his salary. The case was appealed and finally settled in 1784. Solomons died in Montreal eight years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll purchsed as one grouping 18.243 thru 18.247\n\n\n\n\n\nHe married Rebecca Franks (the daughter of Abraham, a prominent Montreal merchant) 5/31/1775.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{3F36186F-673C-4B02-BD50-334D55192AF5}","objects_refno":"2007.02.08.00002","objects_customfield_6":"A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF EARLY AMER.

In 1777 he was in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania in the employ of Aaron Levy. He returned to Philadelphia in 1782.\n\n\n\nAaron Levy was a Revolutionary patriot; founder of Aaronsburg, Pa.; born in Amsterdam in 1742; died in Philadelphia Feb. 23, 1815. He went to America at an early age and settled in Pennsylvania, his name appearing in the first tax-assessment lists of Northumberland County. He engaged in trade with the Indians and furnished supplies to the proprietary government, and, during the war of the Revolution, to the colonial army. In 1778 Levy signed a memorial of the inhabitants of Northumberland county asking help on account of the British and Indian ravages in the vicinity. In the same year he removed to Lancaster, engaging in business with Joseph Simon. He speculated in land in Pennsylvania, and soon became one of the largest landed proprietors, owning immense tracts in nearly every county in the state. \n\n\n\nRobert Morris, the financier of the Revolution, was Levy's partner in many of these speculations, and borrowed considerable sums of money from him, acknowledgment of the indebtedness being made at the time of Morris' bankruptcy. Through the influence of Morris, Levy loaned a large amount of money to the Continental Congress for the purpose of carrying on the war. This money was never fully repaid (see letter in reference to these loans in the Journals of Congress, March 29, 1781). It was after the war that he engaged in his greatest speculation in land, with which his name will always be connected. In 1779 he bought a large tract of land in Center county, Pa., upon which he laid out the town of Aaronsburg, the earliest town in the county, the plan of which was recorded at Sunbury on Oct. 4, 1786; it is the first town in the United States that was planned by, and named after, a Jew. Aaron Levy was one of the original members of the Congregation Mickvթ Israel, Philadelphia.

Loveman & Co., Dry Goods, Millinery and Cloaks, Nashville, TN\n\n\n\nMorris Loveman endured a series of misfortunes before setting down roots in Nashville.  Born in Hungary, Loveman came over with his family to New York City in 1854.  During the voyage, his infant child died.  He initially settled in Owosso, Michigan, where his older brother already lived.  Starting as a peddler, Morris moved into various other failing ventures.  His bakery was unsuccessful and he closed his firecracker manufacturing business after a mishap cost him sight in one of his eyes and hearing in one of his ears.  In 1860, the family moved to Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they opened a dry goods store.  \n\nOnce the war broke out, they sought the relative safety of the city by moving to Nashville.  Morris opened a wholesale dry goods business which supplied many Jewish peddlers in the area.  His son David Loveman opened a dress manufacturing business which became known for its popular line of hoop skirts in the 1860s.  He later opened a dry goods store, D. Loveman's, which grew into a successful department store and Nashville institution.  \n\nWith the addition of partners Samuel W. Berger and Henry Teitelbaum in the 1890s, it became a department store and took the name Loveman, Berger & Teitelbaum, and the sobriquet, The Satisfactory Store.\n\nLoveman, Berger & Teitelbaum, more commonly referred to as Loveman's, was a Nashville, Tennessee-based full service department store, originally located at 5th and Union streets in that city. Relatives of the founder of this chain founded Loveman's of Alabama and Loveman's located in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{7444D3A2-581A-4C07-AE6B-BEAE82F7678C}","objects_refno":"2009.12.07.00002","objects_customfield_6":"The Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life, essay on Nashville","objects_customfield_5":"Loveman, D.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"2/28/1894","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Loveman, D.","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Loveman, D.","location":"Nashville, TN","date":"1894-02-28T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"TN 852","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_tn_852_1r.tif; doc_bhl_tn_852_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.78444,36.165889]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":862,"longitude":-86.78444,"latitude":36.16588852,"ref_1":"ref1342","ref_2":"cid4640703","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"A.

Most likely this is for their first permanent building, refurbish to a synagogue in 1845 and located at 410-420 N. Rampart St. This is considered the first permanent Jewish House of Worship in the State of Louisiana. Gates of Mercy, chartered by the State in 1827, confirmed the abolition of the Code Noir which had denied Jews the right to live and worship in Louisiana and by so doing affirmed American Freedom of Religion and Assembly. It was not until March 5, 1851 that the old building was raised and a new synagogue was built on the same site. At the dedication of the new building in 1851, Isaac Hart was the President of the Congregation;  therefore he was clearly not the President referred to in this note��_in summary this would place the note at the 1845 Consecration.\n\n\n\nThis document is a rare witness to those early years in the founding of the first permanent Jewish House of Worship in Louisiana. As the early minutes books did not survive this may well be one of the few surviving records. Listed on the committee are L. C. Levy. Maurice Hart, Joseph Simon  and M. M. Simpson.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Jewish presence in New Orleans dates to the earliest years of 18th century settlement, formal communal organizations did not develop until many years later. Conforming to the city's generally lax religious atmosphere, the first Jewish residents intermarried freely and assimilated comfortably into New Orleans gentile society. In 1827 Jacob De Silva Solis founded the city's first Jewish congregation, which adopted the name of Shangarai Chasset (Gates of Mercy). The congregation followed the Sephardic Ritual, as many of the original members were of Spanish and Portuguese descent. These early congregants encountered difficulty attracting membership from among their assimilated brethren, and the congregation struggled to hold regulars services and hire reliable rabbis.  To cater to their intermarried members, the congregation allowed non-Jewish spouses to be buried in their cemetery, and allowed children of non-Jewish mothers to be counted as members. By the 1840s increasing numbers of German Jews arrived in the city, breathing new life into the Gates of Mercy congregation. As the German influence grew, Ashkenazi customs and rituals gradually supplanted the earlier Sephardic traditions. These new arrivals also influenced the congregation's by-laws. As membership increased, congregants made fewer concessions to assimilated members, and the congregation barred intermarried men from membership in 1841. By the late 1840s, Gates of Mercy founding Sephardic members grew dissatisfied with the increasing German influence in their congregation, and decided to establish their own congregation in accordance with their Sephardic customs. They named their new congregation Nefutzoth Yehudah (Dispersed of Judah). According to some accounts, this name was chosen in order to attract the attention and largess of Judah Touro, the prominent New Orleans businessman and philanthropist.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{6E6940FC-EF4C-4BCB-9747-A9FA329E92E8}","objects_refno":"2012.01.09.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.01.09.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Hart, Isaac (1814 - 1890) / Abrams, A.","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"4/1/1845","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter is to Isaac Hart ((1814 - 1890) announcing his appointment by the Board of Officers (Shangarai Chasset - Gates of Mercy, New Orleans) to be on the reception for the guests at the Consecration of their first permanent building, to take place on Wed","person_nam":"Hart, Isaac","person_n_1":"Abrams, A.","corporatio":"","merger":"Abrams, A. | Hart, Isaac","location":"New Orleans, LA","date":"1845-04-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"LA 133","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_la_133_1r.tif; doc_ja_la_133_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.07507,29.954649]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":892,"longitude":-90.07506999,"latitude":29.95464869,"ref_1":"ref2416","ref_2":"cid4639637","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"36, 38 & 40 CAMP STREET; ORDER FOR 1,000 POUNDS OF THREAD; KATZ &  BARNETT; ;","thing_uuid":"{9506C125-B321-4B39-B7DF-11BD998560F7}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00199","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.00199","objects_customfield_5":"KATZ / BARNETT","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"1/6/1887","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Letter from Katz and Barnett for an order of 1,0000 pounds of thread","person_nam":"Katz","person_n_1":"Barnett","corporatio":"","merger":"Barnett | Katz","location":"New Orleans, LA","date":"1887-01-06T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"LA 266","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_la_266_1r.tif; doc_bhl_la_266_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.07507,29.954649]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":893,"longitude":-90.07506999,"latitude":29.95464869,"ref_1":"ref2501","ref_2":"cid4639552","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Two page, from I.L.

He is the seventeen year old son of Rabbi Henry Illowy, the Rabbi who after four productive years at Congregation Schaarey Chased has resigned rather than be the Rabbi at a Congregation that has recently been high jacked  by German young men from the North and will reform the Congregation.(see Joseph Jacobsohn letter to Leeser detailing this situation. The Jacobsohn letter was possibly instigated by young Henry). Young Henry will go on to become a pioneer in the field of gastroenterology.\n\n\n\nThe thrust of the letter on the surface is to strongly rebuke Leeser for his attacks on the good Rabbi (Henry's father), However within the letter is a framework of accusations that Leeser is playing the middle between the Reformers and supporting Rabbis who move toward the Reform in order to keep their jobs. Illowy notes that people who know laugh at Leeser for this stance_�_ Your remarks in the last number of the Occident did not hurt neither me (though I felt bad) nor my honored fa=/ther; thank God, he stands above the level of all his enemies neither did they give you any credit for them your best friends blamed you and laughed at you saying: Mr Lesser is afraid of spoiling his game with either party, especially with Gutheim though he is an [Hebrew]; would Lesser be with twenty years younger he would yet become the advocate of reform. \n\n\n.\n\nHis rebukes are an all too familiar refrain on Leeser's dark side_�_ Excuse my giving vent to painful feeling which I can not restrain any longer. Can a son be silent when he sees his father slighted by one whose respect and admiration he deserves? Remember Revd Sir, how often my venerable father appeared before the bar of public opinion to advocate and defend you against the rude at=/tacks of Dr. Wise & Co.! Remember how often my father proclaimed you in all the Jewish periodicals as the only faithful advocate of true Judaism, as the/ restorer of our Religion and Gonfalonier[?] of truth in this country! But you have not a single word to say in his favor, when his enemies try to slander him by false/ and unfounded reports. You asked some time ago, for the reasons of his leaving New Orleans, and I gave you pure wine, the pure truth, without the least admixture of untruth: what did you however write about it? You only heaped slander upon slander; you wrote, you received a communication in favor of Dr. Illowy, but you have no trust in it, this is the essence, if not the words of your report. You have no trust in my father's good character,\n\n\n\nRabbi Bernard Illowy came to America in 1852 as the first Orthodox Rabbi in America to have earned a PhD, became a renowned Orthodox scholar and speaker in the US. It would be clear that eventually Leeser viewed him as an intellectual threat. He had a major falling out with Isaac Leeser over the Cleveland Conference in 1855 and Leeser attacked him in the Occident.\n\n\n\nRabbi Bernard Illowy first had an occasional teaching and preaching job in the Largest Ashkenazim synagogue in NYC Anshei  Chesed. He then accepted a teaching position in the newly formed Hebrew School of Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia. One year later he was named Rabbi. He left in 1854 for St. Louis, then in 1856 for Syracuse and in 1857 left for the Lloyd Street Synagogue in Baltimore. In 1861 he left to become the Rabbi of Shaarei Chesed in New Orleans and retired in 1865.\n\n\n\nDr. Illowy was known as an eminent Talmudist and thorough scholar. He was a strict adherent, in principles and practice, of Orthodox Judaism and from this he never swerved. He preached it in the pulpit, taught it to the children in the congregational schools which he always established wherever he officiated, and championed it in a fierce polemical warfare, extending over many years, with the leaders of the Reform movement in this country, principally Doctors Wise and Lilienthal. He had the distinction of being in his day in this country, the only rabbi with a thorough Talmudic education and a university training to stand for the cause of Orthodoxy.\n\n\n\nHis polemical letters were published in various Jewish periodicals of this country (The Asmonean, the Israelite, the Jewish Messenger, the Occident) and of Europe. He was a powerful and fascinating speaker and convincing preacher, and his ministrations were so successful that his synagogue on Sabbath and holidays was always crowded with worshipers, and many who had strayed away from the fold were brought back again. Many valuable gifts received by him attested the esteem in which he was held by his congregants. Many of his English sermons and addresses were published in both the denominational and the daily press. He was an accomplished linguist, and besides a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, spoke fluently German, English, French, and Italian. His command of Hebrew was remarkable, and some of his polemical letters written in that language were cited as models of elegance of Hebrew composition.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{6F262AA3-DFF6-47D6-9D3A-015AA79CB891}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03472","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03472","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC  / ILLOWY, HENRY (1848.1932)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"10/24/1865","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Five page letter from Henry Illowy, the son of Rabbi Henry Illowy, in New Orleans, Louisiana to Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia.

In the letter Touro relates his problems with a runaway slave. Hart was a long time friend and business associate of Judah Touro. Letters with personal content from Touro are extremety rare.\n\n\n\n  In 1845 David Hart was listed in the pamphlet 100  wealthly citizens of New York City. David Hart was one of the earliest subscribers (1845) to Isaac Leeser's Occident.\n\n\n\nJudah Touro (Newport, Rhode Island, June 16, 1775 - New Orleans, January 13, 1854) was an American businessman and philanthropist. In October, 1801, Judah went to New Orleans, where he opened a small store near the levee, eventually becoming a prominent merchant and shipowner, particularly after the Louisiana Purchase propelled the growth of the region and its commerce. In the War of 1812 he was seriously wounded, but was saved by a friend named Rezin Davis Shepherd,a Virginian merchant.Mr.Shepherd helped nurse Judah back to health,and their close friendship continued throughout their lives. \n\n\n\n \n\n Judah Touro's lasting fame, however, was as a philanthropist. He contributed $40,000-an immense sum at the time-to the Jewish cemetery at Newport, Rhode Island. In New Orleans, he used his business profits to buy and endow a cemetery, and to build a synagogue, an almshouse and an infirmary for sailors suffering from yellow fever, as well as a Unitarian church for a minister named Mr.Theodore Clapp whom he greatly admired. His $20,000 donation to The Jews' Hospital in New York City (now Mount Sinai Hospital) led to its opening in 1855. At his death, his estate provided endowments for nearly all the Jewish congregations in the United States, bequests to hospitals and orphanages in Massachusetts. His bequeaths funded the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside of the old walled city of Jerusalem, Mishkanot Shaanim.[12] In total, his will gave more than $500,000 to different causes, a sum which would equal approximately $9 million in modern terms.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1724A245-39AC-4971-99E6-58521EE4E41D}","objects_refno":"2010.12.11.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.12.11.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Touro, Judah / Hart, David","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"9/1/1835","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Letter from Judah Touro to David Hart regarding problems with a runaway slave","person_nam":"Touro, Judah","person_n_1":"Hart, David","corporatio":"","merger":"Hart, David | Touro, Judah","location":"New Orleans, LA","date":"1835-09-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"LA 157","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_la_157_1r.tif; doc_ja_la_157_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":965,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref225","ref_2":"cid4641814","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"; ; ; ;","thing_uuid":"{93127ACD-D436-4736-B0EC-CC2E32C126CC}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01432","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.01432","objects_customfield_5":"ALTMAN, B. & CO.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"10/2/1893","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Bill from B.

No doubt it was or the troops who were billeted there. Judah Touro, died in 1854. In his will he left a sum of money to establish an almshouse for the relief of the poor and aged. In April, 1862, this edifice was substantially completed. The city was occupied by the Federals a few weeks later. The almshouse, was seized by the Federals under Butler, and used as a barracks. The date for the evacuation of the building was set at September 1, 1865. On the night before, however, fire broke out and the building was completely destroyed. It was not rebuilt and little remains of its history.\n\n\n\nJudah Touro's (Newport, Rhode Island, June 16, 1775 - New Orleans, January 13, 1854) lasting fame was as a philanthropist. He contributed $40,000-an immense sum at the time-to the Jewish cemetery at Newport, and bought the Old Stone Mill there, at that time thought to have been built by Norsemen, giving it to the city. The park surrounding it is still known as Touro Park. In New Orleans, he used his business profits to buy and endow a cemetery, and to build a synagogue, an almshouse and an infirmary for sailors suffering from yellow fever, as well as a Unitarian church for a minister named Mr. Theodore Clapp whom he greatly admired. The infirmary became the largest free hospital in Louisiana, the Touro Infirmary. He was a major contributor to many Christian charities in New Orleans, as well as to such varied causes as the American Revolutionary War monument at Bunker Hill, and the relief of victims of a large fire in Mobile, Alabama. In a New Orleans fund-raising drive for Christians suffering persecution in Jerusalem, he gave ten times more than any other donor. One profile of Touro particularly praised his willingness to give both to Jewish and non-Jewish religious causes: An admirable trait evinced, was the nonsectarian distribution of charity, while the donor ever continued a strict adherent to the principles of his faith. His $20,000 donation to The Jews' Hospital in New York City (now Mount Sinai Hospital) led to its opening in 1855.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{68D5C4FA-97C3-4B12-92F6-4FD8425A93AB}","objects_refno":"2012.01.27.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.01.27.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Touro, Judah","objects_objtype":"RECEIPT","objects_date":"9/20/1862","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Civil War","descript_1":"Requisition from quartermaster Charles M Knapp is for twenty-four birch brooms for the Touro Almshouse","person_nam":"Touro, Judah","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Touro, Judah","location":"New Orleans, LA","date":"1862-09-20T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"LA 158","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_la_158_1r.tif; doc_ja_la_158_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.499896,43.000346]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":936,"longitude":-75.49989586,"latitude":43.00034554,"ref_1":"ref3585","ref_2":"cid4638474","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Official documents","descriptio":"REPORT #303 BY ABOVE AS A THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE, ON THE; MILITIA AND PUBLIC DEFENCE...PRINTED IN ASSEMBLY; SUBJECT IS ON RECEIVING ELLIS'S REPEATING RIFLES IN LIEU OF THE; SATES ARMS QUOTA;","thing_uuid":"{9C78D027-3E49-4774-A427-E4DE252E3CFB}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03334","objects_customfield_6":"A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF EARLY AMER.

Uriah was born in Amsterdam and emigrated to the New York City in 1755.  In New York, he opened a dry goods store. In 1764 he established a metals business. On Uriah���s death in 1798, his only son Harmon took over the business and expanded the company. In 1812, he established one of the first copper-rolling mills in the U.S.  The mill was located in Soho NJ and manager by his brother in law Solomon Isaacs. His clients included the U.S. War Dept and Paul Revere.  Each of Harmon���s four sons joined the business: Uriah, Henry, Washington, and Montague. In 1830, the partnership with Isaacs dissolved and the firm was reorganized with the brothers as partners under the name Hendricks & Brothers with Uriah in charge.\n\n\n\nIn 1861, after the death of Henry, Uriah and Montague changed the name of the firm to Hendricks Brothers and Uriah���s son Joshia became involved in the firm.

H. MACY; ;\n\n\n\nNathan Straus (sometimes Strauss) (1848_�_1931) was an American merchant and philanthropist. He and his brother Isidor brought their family crockery and glassware business to New York City, selling their merchandise in the R.H. Macy & Company department store. The brothers became partners in Macy's in 1888 and co-owners in 1896. They proceeded to develop the enterprise with great success. Nathan Straus also served as New York City Park Commissioner from 1889_�_1893.\n\n\n\nWhile traveling in Europe, Nathan and Isidor and their wives decided to visit the Land of Israel. An anecdote recalls that in 1912 Isidor grew bored of Israel and its strife, whereas Nathan was fascinated by the people and places they encountered throughout the land. Nathan and his wife decided to remain behind, while Isidor and his wife Ida planned to return to the US_�via the ill-fated luxury oceanliner RMS Titanic. Isidor and Ida Straus were among the people who did not survive the ship's sinking.\n\n\n\nNathan's son (Nathan Jr., 1889 - 1961) attended Princeton University and arrived in Heidelberg University in 1908 where he met a young art history scholar named Otto Frank. Otto accepted a job in Macy's with Nathan Strauss Junior. Otto fell in love with New York and its brashness. But in 1909, Otto's father died and he returned to Germany where he would live to fight in World War I and live to see the time when he and his daughters would have to leave Germany because of anti-Semitism. One of Otto's daughters was called Anne Frank.\n\n\n\nNathan believed he and his wife remained alive by some divine action. As a result, he devoted himself and much of his significant fortune to philanthropy throughout Israel. In recognition of his contributions, the modern Israeli city of Netanya, founded in 1927, was named in his honor.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{0D53D9DD-8309-4E88-AA9E-72C70594347A}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02136","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02136","objects_customfield_5":"STRAUS, L. & SONS (LAZARUS)","objects_objtype":"BILLHEAD","objects_date":"9/2/1881","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"L.

Cohen, a stationer by trade, was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1800. Lewis I. Cohen was to make a name for himself as the first American to make lead pencils. He would also become the first stationer in America to sell steel pens in place of old quills. There is a Lewis I. Cohen who in 1829 is listed as a pencil maker at 72 William Street.\n\n\n\nCohen's greatest achievement and contribution to playing card manufacture would come in the form of mechanized colour printing. In 1835 he registered a colour-printing machine that could, in one impression, press four colours. Lewis I. Cohen published his first deck of playing cards in 1832 and formed his business, L. I. Cohen, New York. \n\n\n\nIn 1854 Lewis I. Cohen retired from business and left the card manufactory in the hands of his son, Solomon L. Cohen, and his nephew, John M. Lawrence who formed a partnership and traded under the name Lawrence and Cohen. The two boys continued their brand with the Stars and Eagle, and maintained their share of the market and expanded. On December 5th, 1871, Lawrence and Cohen turned the business into a stock company together with three new partners. The new names in the venture were Samuel Hart and Isaac Levy of _�Samuel Hart & Co._�, Philadelphia, and John J. Levy, a card maker from New York.

Rosenthal Manufacturer, New York Extra Paint Brush Manufactory. \n\n\n\n231 Pearl Street \n\n\n\nH ROSENTHAL & BRO., Manufacturers of Brushes, No. 120 Chambers Street; Factory, No. 50 Warren Street.-At the present day brushes are made from a great variety of materials, from the wire specialty for burnishing the surface of metals to the sable hair brush for artists' uses. The bristles and hair used in the manufacture of brushes are chiefly obtained from Siberia, Russia, and France, which export to the United States two thirds of the entire supply, and the brushes made in New York are well known and appreciated all over this continent, and even Great Britain, for their superior qualities. In this connection special reference is made in this historical review of the industries of the metropolis to the widely-known and old-established house of H. Rosenthal & Bro., manufacturers of fine painters' and artists' brushes, whose office and spacious salesroom are located at No. 120 Chambers Street, running through the entire block to No. 50 Warren Street. The upper floors have a series of galleries the entire length of this very long building, all devoted to manufacturing brushes, with every appliance and facility necessary for the successful prosecution of their business, and where about two hundred experienced and skilled mechanics are almost constantly employed, all guided and under the direct supervision of Mr. Henry Rosenthal, who has created the present excellence of the practical paint-brush over the uncouth, unsightly, and ancient substitute-which a lifetime of study and experience can only accomplish, he having established this business over a quarter-century ago, and so conducted it until 1875, when he admitted his brother, Mr. Maurice Rosenthal, to partnership, whose effort it has been to produce such goods best suited to those markets which his travels embraced. Both partners are thoroughly able and practical brush-makers-fully conversant with every feature and detail of this industry, and the requirements of the trade in all sections of this country. Their business, however, is by no means confined to the United States, as large quantities of the firm's famous brushes are exported to Canada, South America, and Europe. Their specialty is the successful production of fine painters' and artists' brushes, and generally known as the Arrow Brand, which have merited the claim of being absolutely unrivalled for quality, durability, and general excellence, having no superiors in this or any other market.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1B93D924-6D7D-4BF8-9282-9751A1A7918F}","objects_refno":"2009.09.23.00001","objects_customfield_6":"ILLUSTRATED NEW YORK: THE METROPOLIS OF TO-DAY (1888)","objects_customfield_5":"Rosenthal, Henry","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"6/2/1872","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Billhead for H.

H. MACY & CO.; BOTH SIDES 14TH STREET..6TH AVE; BILL FOR AN AGATE PAIL; ;\n\n\n\nNathan Straus (sometimes Strauss) (1848���1931) was an American merchant and philanthropist. He and his brother Isidor brought their family crockery and glassware business to New York City, selling their merchandise in the R.H. Macy & Company department store. The brothers became partners in Macy's in 1888 and co-owners in 1896. They proceeded to develop the enterprise with great success. Nathan Straus also served as New York City Park Commissioner from 1889���1893.\n\n\n\nWhile traveling in Europe, Nathan and Isidor and their wives decided to visit the Land of Israel. An anecdote recalls that in 1912 Isidor grew bored of Israel and its strife, whereas Nathan was fascinated by the people and places they encountered throughout the land. Nathan and his wife decided to remain behind, while Isidor and his wife Ida planned to return to the US���via the ill-fated luxury oceanliner RMS Titanic. Isidor and Ida Straus were among the people who did not survive the ship's sinking.\n\n\n\nNathan's son (Nathan Jr., 1889 - 1961) attended Princeton University and arrived in Heidelberg University in 1908 where he met a young art history scholar named Otto Frank. Otto accepted a job in Macy's with Nathan Strauss Junior. Otto fell in love with New York and its brashness. But in 1909, Otto's father died and he returned to Germany where he would live to fight in World War I and live to see the time when he and his daughters would have to leave Germany because of anti-Semitism. One of Otto's daughters was called Anne Frank.\n\n\n\nNathan believed he and his wife remained alive by some divine action. As a result, he devoted himself and much of his significant fortune to philanthropy throughout Israel. In recognition of his contributions, the modern Israeli city of Netanya, founded in 1927, was named in his honor.\n\n\n\nFamous Jewish American family, originally from Otterberg, the earliest member known was one Lazarus, born in the first half of the eighteenth century, whose son Jacob Lazarus was known also as Jacques Lazare. His son Isaac took the name of Straus in the year 1808, when Napoleon passed the decree ordering all Alsatian Jews to adopt family names. Isaac's son Lazarus was possessed of considerable means, made in both agricultural and commercial pursuits. Being involved in the revolutionary movement of 1848; he emigrated to the United States in 1854 and settled in Talbotton, Ga. In 1865 he established in New York a successful pottery and glassware business, in conducting which he was joined in 1872 by his sons.\n\n\n\n SUIT\n\n\n\n On year 1913 the Government in the Federal District Court filed suit against L. Straus Sons, importers of chinaware of 42 Warren Street on the interpretation of the terms of the customs law. The Government seeks to recover $139,161.04 (HUGE AMOUNT IN THESE YEARS!), the value of the china, which, it alleges, was undervalued by the defendants when they imported it from France between Jan. 1, 1910, and Jan. 1, 1913.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{FBFE3848-5304-4D5C-81C7-E8BF96D4EE38}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01858","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.01858","objects_customfield_5":"STRAUS, ISIDOR / STRAUS,  NATHAN","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"6/10/1899","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Straus, Isidor","person_n_1":"Straus, Nathan","corporatio":"","merger":"Straus, Nathan | Straus, Isidor","location":"New York, NY","date":"1899-06-10T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 598","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_nyc_598_1r.tif;

Jeroliman & Co., 134 William street, New York, successors to Lewis I. Cohen, is listing Lewis Cohen Playing Cards. Early American playing card catalogues are scarce.\n\n\n\nThis document is in conflict with the histories written on Lewis Cohen. Nowhere is it noted that he sold his establishment in 1848 to H.J. Jeroliman. There was a Jeroliman, Motley and Company listed in Knickerbockers 1852. Histories lists 1854 as the date Lewis Cohen retired!!!Possibly he sold the stationary store to concentrate on card manufacturing Lewis I. Cohen was one of the earliest playing card manufacturers in the United States. \n\n\n\nLewis I. Cohen , a stationer by trade, was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1800. His father was Joseph Cohen who came to America in 1768; by 1799 he was listed as the household Rabbi of Joseph Simon in Lancaster_�_ Joseph Cohen died in England (1822).  Lewis went to England in 1814, and he was apprenticed to his half brother, Solomon Cohen, a well-known lead pencil manufacturer in London. In 1819, he returned to the United States on the barque Mary and Susan. Lewis I. Cohen was to make a name for himself as the first American to make lead pencils. He would also become the first stationer in America to sell steel pens in place of old quills. There is a Lewis I. Cohen who in 1829 is listed as a pencil maker at 72 William Street.\n\n\n\nCohen's greatest achievement and contribution to playing card manufacture would come in the form of mechanized colour printing. He was a pioneer in the field, and like many of his contemporaries (George Baxter 1836, Thomas de la Rue, 1831) came up with a very similar solution for the problem of printing four colours in one pass. In 1835 he registered a colour-printing machine that could, in one impression, press four colours. Lewis I. Cohen published his first deck of playing cards in 1832 and formed his business, L. I. Cohen, New York. His insignia (the Ace of Spades) was to be an Eagle perched atop the suit symbol, enshrined by thirteen shining stars. Though, sometimes, the stars were omitted. \n\n\n\nFrom 1838 to 1844 he spent considerable sums of money enlarging his premises and expanding his enterprise, and in 1845 he issued a deck of gold embossed playing cards. That was all the Kings and Queens, and all the numbers, Cohen embossed with gold around the suit symbols and on the royal attire. Nothing says it quite like gold. In 1850, he sold the stationery side of the business, which was now dwarfed by the card manufactory and it wasn't long before the young Mister Cohen could put his feet up and let his sons take the reins. In 1854 Lewis I. Cohen retired from business and left the card manufactory in the hands of his son, Solomon L. Cohen, and his nephew, John M. Lawrence who formed a partnership and traded under the name Lawrence and Cohen. The two boys continued their brand with the Stars and Eagle, and maintained their share of the market and expanded. On December 5th, 1871, Lawrence and Cohen turned the business into a stock company together with three new partners.

It was written by Fromental Halթvy. The story of an impossible love between a Christian man and a Jewish woman, the work may be seen as a plea for religious tolerance, in much the same spirit as Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots which premiered in 1835, a year before La Juive, as well as the 1819 novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott which deals with the same theme. At the time of composition, the July monarchy had liberalized religious practices in France. Meyerbeer and Halթvy were both Jewish and storylines dealing with topics of tolerance were common in their operas. The reviews of the initial performances show that journalists of the period responded to the liberalism and to the perceived anti-clericalism of Scribe's text, rather than to any specifically Jewish theme. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{3CA393E1-A416-4D85-A8A1-07C79E144C18}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02141","objects_customfield_6":"NOT THE PLAY PERFORMED IN USA 1795...SEE ITEM 298","objects_customfield_5":"Halevy, Fromental","objects_objtype":"BROADSIDE","objects_date":"1/1/1836","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Broadside for the famous opera, \"The Jewess,\" at Ford Theater.

Hi Arny - it just occurred to me that since these prayers are recited for Yom Kippur, it makes sense that the date would actually be the Fall of 1846 (which is 607 in the Hebrew calendar), i.e., not the Fall of 1847.  If the date is Fall of 1846, this may be the LAST use of this prayer printed specially for the Franklin Street congregation of Sha'are Tefilah.  In the Fall of 1847, presumably they would already have been in the new synagogue building on Wooster street.   If so, I wonder if there is any special significance to the printer (Ya'akov b. Shelomoh)'s decision to indicate the Franklin Street location, i.e., an awareness that this might be the last time it would be recited at Franklin Street?\n\n\n\nThis is possiblly the earliest insert of   \n\n\n\n\n\nPrinted by Jacob Ben Solomon (Jackson, J.M. Jr.) for the Congregation Shaaray Tefila (Hebrew for Gates of Prayer). The congregation was organized in 1845, and its first place of worship was in Franklin Street, near Broadway. In 1846 (completed in 1847), the congregation erected a synagogue on Wooster Street, near Spring Street, at a cost of $50,000. This synagogue was designed by Blesch & Eidlitz and served the congregation for nineteen years.\n\n\n\n This rare 1847 ,early American liturgy, printing is unknown to Singerman who records only a later issue of this sheet, printed by Jackson for the same congregation in 1849, but in English and Hebrew (cf. 1073, listing one copy in library HUC). This is mostl likely the earliest printing of this liturgy in America, none earlier are listed in Singermam or American Jewish Liturgies by Wachs.\n\n\n\nSolomon Henry Jackson, J.M. Jackson's father, came to USA circa 1797, married Ministers daughter & had 5 children. When she died he moved to NYC and raised children in Jewish faith. In years 1823 to 1825 edited and published the first Jewish periodical in USA. In 1826 he translated and published and English/Hebrew Bible and in 1836 the first Haggadah in American. His son J. M.

Merzbach, Hecht, Heilner, and Danziger, of the respective congregations Emmanuel, Anshay Chased, Rodef Sholem and Shaar Hashamayim of New York, affording a pleasing contrast to the paucity of ministers not more than fifteen years ago; notwithstanding there were absent a great many others belonging to the various Kehilloth of New York, amongst whom we particularly regretted Rev. Dr. Lilienthal and the Rev. Mr. Leo.\n\n\n\nCongregation Shaaray Tefila (Hebrew for Gates of Prayer) was organized in 1845, and its first place of worship was in Franklin Street, near Broadway. In 1846, the congregation erected a synagogue on Wooster Street, near Spring Street, at a cost of $50,000. This synagogue was designed by Blesch & Eidlitz and served the congregation for nineteen years. In 1862 the Wooster Street building was sold and the congregation met in the old armory building that was on the site of the Herald Building.  \n\nFollowing the Civil War years, the congregation erected a new synagogue on a midblock site at 127 West Forty-fourth Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Henry Fernbach designed the synagogue in a variety of styles described by Occident magazine as Byzantine Mooresque, and its exterior was noted for a central entrance pavilion with a gilded dome above. The sanctuary, described by Moses King as richly decorated and costly, was illuminated by a large rose window over the ark, which, following tradition, was located on the east wall, oriented toward Jerusalem, despite the fact that this placement was awkward in a south-facing building. In keeping with Orthodox tradition, there was a separate gallery for the women. The synagogue was built at a cost of $200,000 and was consecrated in May, 1869.\n\nBy the 1880s the area had become less residential as the city expanded to the north. Within a few years, the theatre district would move to 42nd Street. The 44th Street synagogue was sold in February 1893, and in May of the same year construction began on a new synagogue on West 82nd Street. On October 5, 1893, the cornerstone was laid for a building that would occupy the 75 by 102 foot lot. Designed by Arnold W. Brunner in a Byzantine-Moorish style, the West End Synagogue, as it would be known, was built of Indiana limestone, brick and terra cotta. The main entrance was arcaded, over which were an elaborate group of arched windows separated by slender columns with carved capitals. A double flight of steps led to the brick and stone vestibule that had a floor of marble mosaic. The sanctuary had galleries on three sides and provided seating for 650 people in a room that was 60 by 70 feet in size and 50 feet high. The ark, crafted of walnut and oak with rich inlays and gilded, was of Moorish style and came from the old synagogue. Above the ark were arcaded windows that were illuminated from behind.\n\nThe congregation's present sanctuary, located on the corner of East 79th Street and Second Avenue, was was originally built as the Colony movie theatre, later to become a Trans-Lux theatre. The shell of the theatre was converted for use as a synagogue, as designed by John J. McNamara and Horace Ginsbern & Associates, and was dedicated on September 25, 1959. Since moving to the East Side, the congregation reverted to its original and legal name of Shaaray Tefila. The Congregation today is Reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{41F2DE0A-7C65-460C-8A85-D093501F8040}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03341","objects_customfield_6":"This 1847 printing is unknown to Singerman or Wach who records only a later issue of this sheet, printed by Jackson for the same congregation in 1849 (cf. 1073, listing one copy in library HUC)","objects_customfield_5":"JACKSON, J.M.

(SINGERMAN 0471).\n\n\n\nThis broadside is a rare glimpse into the early Jewish charitable institutional period of New York City. Solomon Jackson is clearly furious these gentlemen. It is an historical marker in the history of Jewish Charitable Institutions in America. He opens that he stands alone against the Christian Clergy which backs the _��American Society for the Ameliorating the Conditions of the Jews_�� _�_with their _��enormous fund_��. He notes that Mordecai Noah has said _��there are no poor Jews in New York_��_�__��and _��comparatively speaking, there are none, that would require the formation of a society for their relief_�� In the body of the broadside Jackson notes that while partially true it is because the wealthy through the Society For the Education of the Poor Children and the relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion pays for the poor to leave the City with a one way ticket. He accuses the Society of demeaning the poor peddler, even though a number of the wealthy count their wealth as starting from that path. Further he accuses them of not supporting fellow Jews in the trades with examples of a cobbler, paperhanger and sign painter and thereby forcing them into the role as petty peddlers.\n\n\n\nJackson also touches upon the education of the two orphans under the care of the Society. They are sent to Christian schools rather than being given a Jewish education. His summary is in the beginning _��Gentlemen, by your doings, by their tendency and consequences must you be tried, and then, Mene Takel, ye are weighed in the scale and found wanting._��\n\n\n\nJackson came to USA circa 1797, married Ministers daughter & had 5 children. When she died he moved to NYC and raised children in Jewish faith. In years 1823 to 1825 edited and published the first Jewish periodical in USA. In 1826 he translated and published and English/Hebrew Bible and in 1836 the first Haggadah in American. His son Henry Jackson continued in both Religious as well as commercial printing\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND on JACKSON FOUNDING the First Jewish Periodical in America_�_.. American Society For Meliorating The Condition Of The Jews, a missionary organization founded by a number of ministers of various Christian denominations in New York City in February, 1820, with the cooperation of a converted Jew, Joseph Simon Christian Frederick Frey. In 1822 Frey became agent of the Society. In 1824 the Society made an unsuccessful attempt to found a settlement for agricultural and mechanical operations of its Jews, and a monthly publication was started under the name of Israel_��s Advocate. The Society hired a house and three acres of land in the environs of New York City as a place of reception for such Jews as may from time to time come to this country, where accommodations will be provided for them as one family at the expense of the Society; and whence, at their option, they may locate on our agricultural establishment, or engage elsewhere in any employment. In 1824 the society had an annual income of more than $ 17,000, over 200 auxiliary branches, extending from Maine to Georgia, and its organ, Israel_��s Advocate, had a circulation of 20,000. \n\n\n\nThis periodical, although consisting for the most part merely of reprints of European versions of Jewish conversions, speeches and sermons on the subject, was important in that it formed the only source of information regarding the Jews in thousands of American homes, and in that it led to the formation of the monthly The Jew, the first Jewish periodical in America, which was edited in New York City by Solomon H. Jackson from 1823 to 1825. From 1839 to 1860 the Society continued to drift along, leading a troubled existence of conflict, controversy, and few converts. The main cause contributing to the decline of the Society was the Jewish population had increased to more than 50,000 by 1860 and hence individual Jews were less susceptible to missionary influences.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{4E49CA5A-0564-4735-871B-E5F04D934723}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03348","objects_customfield_6":"SINGERMAN 0471...only one other known copy","objects_customfield_5":"JACKSON, Solomon Henry (? - 1847) /DREYFOUS, JOSEPH / PHILLIPS, A.N. / MOSES, MONTGO","objects_objtype":"Broadside","objects_date":"10/29/1829","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A printed address by Solomon Jackson (-1847) to Joseph Dreyfous, A.N.

Gray, Daniel L.M.... To the Medical Societies, Faculties, and Colleges in the United States. [first lines from printed circular] [New York]: [s.n.], [October 22nd, 1831]. Printed circular, one page with integral address leaf. Not on OCLC. . An interesting document concerning attempts in the American medical community to bring professional integrity and standards to American medicine. This notice is from a committee of five physicians (John F. Gray, Daniel L.M. Peixotto, H.B. Gram, William James MacNeven, and Felix Pascalis) who were appointed by the New York Medical Society. The goal of this committee was to correspond with faculty and medical societies across the United States regarding examinations for the licensing of any potential medical student who wished to practice medicine and surgery. In this circular, the committee lists six major points they deemed as salient and imperative for granting valid licenses and conducting prudent medical examinations. The signers of this circular are notable: Daniel Levy Maduro Peixotto (1767-1828) was a Jewish physician and scholar. He was president of the New York Medical Society from 1830-32. William James MacNeven (1763-1841) was an Irish patriot who emigrated to America in 1805 and established what may have been the first laboratory in New York. MacNeven was also a member of the APS. Felix Pascalis-OuvriՌre (1750-1833) was a noted physician. His experiences in the West Indies made him, at the time, a creditable authority of the yellow fever epidemics that afflicted Philadelphia and New York in the late 18th century. (He was later known as simply Felix Pasalis.) Address leaf with some paper loss along edge, to red wax seal, transmitted to Benjamin Lincoln, M.D. of Burlington, Vermont. Bottom margin of circular with name in ms. of Philip E. Milledoler, presumably Rev. Milledoler (1775-1852), theologian and fifth president of Rutgers University [DAB.]\n\n\n\nDaniel was th eldest son of Moses Levy Maduro Peixotto (1767-1828); physician, scholar, author, and philanthropist; born in Amsterdam July 18, 1800; died in New York 1843. He was educated in Cura�_ao under the direction of Professor Strebeck. He accompanied his father to New York and graduated from Columbia College at the age of sixteen, receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1819. \n\n\n\nHe was a member of the old Philolexian Society of the college, the membership of which society still includes the names of his descendants. Prior to taking his degree he had entered the office of Dr. David Hosack, at one time physician to George Washington.\n\n\n\n Peixotto was one of the editors of the New York Medical and Physical Journal and of Gregory's Practice (1825-26) and was a frequent contributor to the periodicals and newspapers of the day. Later on he edited The True American, advocating the election of Gen. Andrew Jackson, and he was also connected with the New York Mirror.\n\n\n\nAmong the many offices held by him were the following: secretary of the Academy of Medicine (1825); physician to the City Dispensary (1827); and president of the New York Medical Society (1830-32); he was also one of the organizers of the Society for Assisting the Widows and Orphans of Medical Men.\n\n\n\nThe title of Professor of the Theory and Practise of Medicine and Obstetrics was given him in 1836, and in the same year he was elected to honorary membership in the Medical Society of Lower Canada.\n\n\n\n Having accepted the appointment of president of the Willoughby Medical College, he removed to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was dean of the faculty for a number of years. Returning to New York, he resumed his practise there, and continued it until his death. He married Rachel M. Seixas, the daughter of Benjamin Seixas, March 19, 1823.\n\n\n\nA practicing Jew.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{3C18E437-13CA-452C-869B-BDCEF85BA606}","objects_refno":"2008.02.22.00003","objects_customfield_6":"Not in American Imprints","objects_customfield_5":"Peixotto, Daniel Levy Maduro (1800-1843)","objects_objtype":"BROADSIDE","objects_date":"10/22/1831","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Notice from a committee of five physicians, including Daniel L.

Benjamin Seixas vs. John Delafield. Signed Feb. 21, 1799, by, Edward W. Laight, who notes true copy. Statements, Jan. 26, 1799, of George Lewis, a deponent for Seixas. \n\n\n\nThe interesting text includes mention various parties involved in the purchase and sale of subscriptions to the Bank of the United States in 1791. The gist is that Seixas and Isaac Whippo have at times been in partnership and did an action by one necessarily bind the other, re: subscription to the stock of the first Bank of the United States.  Benjamin Seixas and Isaac Whippo had a Commission Office at No. 53 Wall Street . The names listed in the suit read as a NYC financial  who's who��_  Nicholas Low; William Duer; Richard Platt; Daniel C. Verplanck; Isaac Whippo.\n\n\n\nAn important suit between Benjamin Seixas (son of Rabbi Gershom Seixas), one of the founders of the NYSE, and John Delafield one of the wealthiest men in USA. \n\n\n\nWhippo was noted is an article as osyster sucker lately turned stockbroker!\n\n\n\nDELAFIELD, John, merchant, born in England, 16 March 1748; died in New York City, 3 July 1824. Soon after coming of age he immigrated to this country. The ship upon which he took passage bore letters of marquee, and captured a French vessel. Mr. Delafield volunteered in the action, and shared the prize money to the extent of Σ100. He landed in New York City, 5 April 1783, and found himself especially welcomed as the bearer of a manuscript copy of the text of the treaty of peace, which had been handed him at the moment of sailing by an official in the British service. The conditions of peace were known, but the text had not yet been made public in England; and, although the official copy had been forwarded, the 'Vigilant had outstripped the bearer of the government dispatches by some days. After several experiments, Sir Delafiehl established himself in New York as a merchant. He was exceptionally successful, retiring in 1798 one of the wealthiest men in the country.\n\n \n\nA twelvemonth afterward he was at the head of the private underwriters of the City. Time brought reverses, as both the French and the English were striving to sweep American commerce from the seas. While many of the private underwriters were obliged to suspend, Mr. Delafield was among those who paid every loss, but only by sacrificing his entire capital and mortgaging his real estate. He was a founder and director of the Mutual insurance company, established 15 June 1787, that being the first company organized to take risks against fire in the City of New York after the Revolution. On 12 January 1792, he was appointed n director of the branch of the U. S. bank, and was afterward elected to the same office. He was one of forty gentlemen who subscribed $10,000 each, and founded (1 February 1796) the United insurance company, also acting as a director, and serving as president for many years. His summer residence on the East River, opposite Blackwell's island, known as Sunswick, built in 1791, was one of the largest and best appointed private houses near New York. \n\nEdward W. Laight (1773-1852) - Lawyer; graduate of Columbia College [then Kings], studied under Aaron Burr.

Levy is selling 2600 acres of land in Albany County on the east side of the Hudson River near Lake George.  According to the bio on Levy, he was in the fur trade, and his business failed in 1768, so perhaps this is when he was selling off his property.  There are also many British non-commissioned soldiers mentioned in the document, no doubt previous owners under land grants from the Frence & Indian War. He is selling the property to Solomon Meyers Cohen. \n\n\n\nSolomon Meyers Cohen was born in NYC, the son of Abraham  Meyers Cohen, a NYC shopkeeper who became a Freeman of NYC about 1737 & was naturalized  about 1741.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHayman Levy was a Colonial merchant of New York; born in 1721; died in New York in 1789. He engaged in business at an early age, and is mentioned as the owner of a privateer and as engaged in the fur trade in 1760 (see New York Mercury, Aug. 17, 1761). In 1765 the signature Hayman Levy, Junior, was appended to the Non-Importation Resolutions drawn up by merchants in Philadelphia, but it can not be said with certainty that it was the signature of the Hayman Levy treated here. In 1770 Levy signed in New York resolutions of a similar but more stringent character. In 1768 he failed in business, but soon recovered his losses. The occupation of New York by the British caused him to remove to Philadelphia. On July 20, 1776, he is mentioned in the Journal of the Continental Congress. Hayman Levy was one of the founders of the Congregation Mickv�� Israel (founded in 1740's) when it was formally organized in 1782, and served on the first board of trustees. In 1784 he returned to New York and aided in the reestablishment of the congregation in that city. He was one of the most widely known merchants of New York, and was probably the first employer of John Jacob Astor. He had sixteen children, some of whom were prominent citizens of New York.  \n\n","thing_uuid":"{4D7320FC-5F55-4229-B19E-16F545EB1BB2}","objects_refno":"2009.08.08.00001","objects_customfield_6":"Biograhical Dictionary of Early American Jews by Rosenbloom","objects_customfield_5":"Levy, Hayman (1721-1789) / Cohen, Solomon  Meyers (1744-1796)","objects_objtype":"DEED","objects_date":"1/1/1771","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"This is an 18th-century New York deed between Hayman Levy, a colonial merchant in the fur trage, and Solomon Meyers-Cohen, a New York City shopkeeper.

A father writes for over one page in small hand his charge to his young adult son on living a meaningful life��_\n\n\n\n��_��_There is nothing pleases me more than to hear you feel interested in any worthy society as it gives one a chance of doing some good, at some time. I think a man can never be better employed than in trying to improve himself in order to benefit others, for what is life worth if it is all engrossed by self, it is not the rich should be respected but he who has done the most to benefit mankind, the most lowly, the poorest has something to do, if it is only a kind word spoken in right time. Oh my dear child never turn a deaf ear to the tale of woe, the smallest gift, or kind word may be all, but it will be like the widow and the mite large in the sight of our heavenly father and like that also be returned a hundred fold. But I know your heart is kind and your feelings are young and fresh and you may be imposed upon and that may harden you in (later) life but it is better to meet 20 imposters than one should suffer. But it is not in bestowing alms that one can always do good, encouraging labor is more real good as it creates a spirit of independence which the pauper loses and becomes at once a drone on society. But I suppose this part does not come in the debates of your literary associates and it is well it does not as you must all be too young to meddle with such matters. But it would be my delight to see or hear of an association where all who applied for aid could be supplied with work to meet their abilities at remunerative prices then the bit they earned would taste sweet and would not be squandered. Not like the Ladies societies to meet to make up clothes for the poor, everyone that goes leaves some duty neglected at home, and at the same time deprives some poor woman of the price of the making. This is a strange letter to write you surley but I have had so much this winter to make me think of it that it was down before I knew and perhaps sometime in your life it may come to your mind as forcibly as it now does to mine. Goodbye my own dear Boy may all your works be pleasing in the sight of our Heavenly Father  is the prayer of your Mother while life shall last.","thing_uuid":"{C7E91CFE-6245-44EA-897A-35F8EF6116B9}","objects_refno":"2012.01.15.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.01.15.00001","objects_customfield_5":"","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"12/26/1835","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from a father to his son on living a meaningful life","person_nam":"David","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"David","location":"New York, NY","date":"1835-12-26T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 1036","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_1036_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_1036_1v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_1036_2r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_1036_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1332,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref2437","ref_2":"cid4639616","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"(ASD) BUSINESS LETTER FROM ALEXANDER; ; ; ;","thing_uuid":"{33A2429A-7ECF-43CC-BB3C-D56D1A04AF67}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02722","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02722","objects_customfield_5":"KURSHEEDT, ALEXANDER (1811.1884)","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"11/18/1837","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Signed business letter from Alexander Kursheedt (1811-1884)","person_nam":"Kursheedt, Alexander","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Kursheedt, Alexander","location":"New York, NY","date":"1837-11-18T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 908","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_908_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_908_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1317,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref2232","ref_2":"cid4639821","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"LETTER TO  FROM ATTORNEY LEWIS RE: A MEETING THEY ARE TO HAVE IN; JUDGE CARDOZA'S OFFICE...ALL PART OF SUIT IN ITEM #1988; \n\n\n\nHe was the 1/2 brother of Jacob Raphael De Cordova.

De Cordova in New York, New York to Rabbi Sabato Morais, the Rabbi of Mikveh Israel.  De Cordova asks advice on changing his public lectures from semi-comical to the serious issue of the condition of Jews in civilized countries and would like his input on Jews in Italy.\n\n\n\nRaphael J. De Cordova was born in Jamaica and came to New York in 1848. He became well known as a somewhat comic lecturer and editorial writer. When Temple Emanu'el's Rabbi died unexpectedly they wanted English lectures but it was impossible to procure the services of a regular minister. An invitation was extended to the well-known and talented English lecturer, Raphael J. De Cordova, to deliver lectures upon moral and sacred subjects.  They hired De Cordova as a lay preacher; he served from February, 1858, until May, 1864.\n\n\n\n HISTORY of MORAIS   In 1845 he went to London to apply for the vacant post of assistant Hassan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city. (The position of Hassan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais. \n\n\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. Morais became a major force in shaping American Judaism. He was a founder of Conservative Judaism in the America. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{C22C0F06-E134-4A05-BFCC-E3FAB1640CCC}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03648","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03648","objects_customfield_5":"DE CORDOVA, RAPHAEL J. / MORAIS, SABATO","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"7/6/1860","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter penned by Raphael J.

This important letter demonstrates the difficulties in forming the Board of Delegates of American Israelites.\n\n\n\nSingerman did not locate this copy\n\n\n\nHistory��_.In 1859, in response to a perceived lack of American Jewish unity in the face of political turmoil, twenty-four mostly Ashkenazic congregations, led by Shaaray Tefilla of New York and Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, form the Board of Delegates of American Israelites to keep a watchful eye on all occurrences at home and abroad. A year earlier, 6-year-old Edgardo Mortara of Italy was taken from his home and handed over to the Catholic Church after it was discovered he had been secretly baptized by his nursemaid. A Catholic in Italy could not legally be raised by Jews, even his own parents. Despite numerous petitions from various American Jewish groups, President James Buchanan refused to intervene, stating that the US should not meddle in the affairs of other independent governments. \n\n\n\nBelieving that their appeal had failed because of their own disorganization, Jewish leaders established a Board of Delegates, modeling it on the influential Jewish Board of Deputies in London--but due to communal infighting, only a small fraction of the synagogues in America participated. Nonetheless, says Gary Zola, the Board's creation demonstrated the early determination of American Jewry to use their political influence at home to defend embattled Jews anywhere. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{F93E2717-0859-467E-982E-F150D27D7167}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03549","objects_customfield_6":"SINGERMAN not listed","objects_customfield_5":"ISAACS, MYER S.","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"3/20/1861","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Printed letter from the \"\"Board of Delegates of American Israelites\"\" from Myer S.

I of course had as many classes nearly as pupils, and apart/ from Hebrew & German had to undertake personally all the various branches of instruction, to organise[sic!] a school properly, under these circumstances, without/ the aid of assistant teachers, was impracticable [crossed-out: under such] the incapacity of some, the indolence/ and obstinacy of others were serious obstacles, but I bore up against all discouragement and during the last/ year my school was supplied with capable teachers/ in Hebrew in German in Music in latin.

See below the background on the public battle between the two major figures in mid-19th century American Judaism.  \n\n\n\nIsaac Leeser had serious public arguments with the learned Rev. H. A.

Henry accusing Leeser of a series unfounded personal attacks, ever since the writer landed in America, that threatens his reputation and livelihood. From Kursheedt's letter It would seem that Leeser battles with Henry started after he was in Cincinnati (is it possible that Leeser had suggested the New Orleans position to him and he instead took the Cincinnati position thereby undercutting Leeser's role as king maker). It should be noted that when Henry resigned his Cincinnati post in July 1852, the Congregation gave him a fine testimonial and recommendation_�_all of which Leeser published in the Occident.

(The position of Hazzan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.\n\n\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia, became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. Morais became a major force in shaping American Judaism. He was a founder of Conservative Judaism in the America.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{F757D6F8-A10D-4EA5-B162-934FABEBB758}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03474","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03474","objects_customfield_5":"LYON, ROBERT / MORAIS, REV.","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"10/26/1859 (date must be wrong..Lyon died in 1858)","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Robert Lyon in New York to Rev.

Lyon is asking Leeser to issue a statement absolving Lyon of guilt. It is; quite possible the letter was instrumental in precipitating the long standing feud between Leeser and Wise. The letter quotes verbatim from the editorial.\n\n\n\nAs an important note, from 1852 until his departure to Cincinnati in 1854, Isaac Mayer Wise, then in Albany, served as the journal's coeditor.

Its two pages are replete with business and personal family matters.\n\n\n\nThe letter recipient was business partner, Moses Myers (ca. 1752-1835). With brother, Samuel Myers (1755-1836), the threesome were members of a trading house in New York and Amsterdam and were involved in many aspects of wartime commerce.

Moses was originally from New York, and after occupation by the British went to Philadelphia. Moses was an active privateer during the war; he gave liberally to support the furnishing of supplies and provisions to the U.S. Armies and other fundraising ventures. He became president of Mickve Israel. On returning from Philadelphia, he was among the first of the group who established the Bank of New York. \n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{46147F6E-4B86-44A2-9F61-14B95B106A30}","objects_refno":"2008.04.26.00011","objects_customfield_6":"THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OF PHILADELPHIA BY WHITEMAN.","objects_customfield_5":"Moses, Isaac  / Myers, Moses","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"8/8/1784","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Moses, Isaac","person_n_1":"Myers, Moses","corporatio":"","merger":"Myers, Moses | Moses, Isaac","location":"New York, NY","date":"1784-08-08T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 946","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_946_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_946_1v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_946_2r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_946_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1363,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref2906","ref_2":"cid4639148","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"LETTER RE: BANKRUPCY; 27 CHAMBER STREET; ASD; ;","thing_uuid":"{33BCFFA1-ACAF-4BB8-9DC0-F9D3B82A160B}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02613","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02613","objects_customfield_5":"MOSES, MAX","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"12/8/1873","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"A letter regarding bankruptcy","person_nam":"Moses, Max","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Moses, Max","location":"New York, NY","date":"1873-12-08T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 600","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_nyc_600_1r.tif; doc_bhl_nyc_600_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1364,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref2938","ref_2":"cid4639116","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"New York Cheap Transportation Association.

It is about family and business. He notes that he has set up a meeting with an important man.....make yourself acceptable to him in a modest and proper manner...this letter is timeless!!! Personal letters such as this are rare an virtually non-existent out of Institutions.\n\n\n\nMordecai Manuel Noah (July 14, 1785, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,- May 22, 1851, New York) was an American playwright, diplomat, journalist, and utopian. Born in a family of Portuguese Sephardic ancestry; he was the first Jew born in the United States to reach national prominence.\n\nNoah engaged in trade and law, but when removing to Charleston, South Carolina, dedicated himself to politics. In 1811, he was appointed by President James Madison as consul at Riga, then part of Imperial Russia, but declined, and, in 1813, was nominated Consul to the Kingdom of Tunis, where he rescued American citizens kept as slaves by Moroccan masters. Allegedly, Noah was removed from this position because, in the words of US Secretary of State James Monroe, his religion was an obstacle to the exercise of [his] Consular function. The firing caused outrage among Jews and non-Jews alike. Noah protested and gained letters from John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison supporting church-state separation and tolerance for Jews. Prominent Reform Judaism leader Isaac Harby was moved to write, in a letter to Monroe, [Jews] are by no means to be considered as a religious sect, tolerated by the government. They constitute a portion of the People. They are, in every respect, woven in and compacted with the citizens of the Republic. From his experiences in North Africa he wrote 1813 - 1814: Travels in England, France, Spain, and the Barbary States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMordecai moved to New York City. He started a letter-writing campaign to reestablish his good name, advanced his career in journalism, and continued his political activities. His uncle, Naphtali Phillips, owned the National Advocate, a convenient platform for political publicity.  Mordecai soon became the chief editor at this prestigious enterprise, and he remained an editor or associate editor of different New York publications for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\nIn 1819, Noah's most successful play, She Would Be a Soldier, was produced. That play has since established Noah as America's first important Jewish American writer. She Would Be a Soldier is now included in college level anthologies. His plays include Paul and Alexis (1812), a melodrama retiled The Wandering Boys (1821); She Would Be a Soldier (1819); The Siege of Tripoli (1820), also produced as Yuseff Caramalli but unprinted; Marion; or, The Hero of Lake George (1821); and The Grecian Captive (1822).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1821 Noah became Sheriff of New York. The National Advocate changed owners in 1826, and Noah changed political allegiance and left the Advocate. He started his own newspaper and became a supporter of Governor DeWitt Clinton, a Republican. Adroit political manipulations kept Noah on the winning side of the political fence. \n\n\n\nIn 1825, with virtually no support from anyone-not even his fellow Jews- in a precursor to modern Zionism, he tried to found a Jewish refuge at Grand Island in the Niagara River, to be called Ararat, after Mount Ararat, the Biblical resting place of Noah's Ark. He had brought with him a cornerstone which read Ararat, a City of Refuge for the Jews, founded by Mordecai M. Noah in the Month of Tishri, 5586 (September, 1825) and in the Fiftieth Year of American Independence. Noah also shared the belief among various others that some of the Native American Indians were from the Lost Tribes of Israel, from which he wrote the Discourse on the Evidences of the American Indians being the Descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel.[ In his Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews Noah proclaimed his faith that the Jews would return and rebuild their ancient homeland and called on America to take the lead in this endeavor. On September 2, soon after arriving in Buffalo from New York, Noah led a small procession to the local Episcopal Church. Here, there was a brief ceremony- including a singing of the psalms in Hebrew- the cornerstone was laid on the communion table, and the new proclamation establishing the refuge was read. This was the beginning and the end of Mordecai Noah's venture: he lost heart and returned to New York a couple days later without once having set foot on the island. The cornerstone was taken out of the audience chamber of the church and laid against the back of the building. It is now on permanent display at the Buffalo Historical Society in Buffalo, NY.\n\n\n\nFrom 1827-1828, Noah led New York City's Tammany Hall political machine. He was a staunch supporter of slavery. He worried that emancipation would threaten the whole country's safety.\n\n\n\nMacArthur Award-winning cartoonist Ben Katchor fictionalized Noah's scheme for Grand Island in his The Jew of New York. Noah is also a minor character in Gore Vidal's 1973 novel Burr. The modern edition of Noah's writings is The Selected Writings of Mordecai Noah edited by Michael Schuldiner and Daniel Kleinfeld, and published by Greenwood Press.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CE46A1B7-0128-4BB2-8046-9F5C9E8257CC}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03459","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03459","objects_customfield_5":"NOAH, MORDECAI MANUEL / NOAH, JACOB","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"10/1/1850","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Personal letter from Mordecai M.

This is a great mistake. Henry Caucisi is in every \n\nway competent. This young man, an Italian by birth of a noble family of Rome, from his early propensity for the profession of Phidias \n\nwas placed by his friends under the instruction of Canova. He was a favorite pupil of the eminent artist for many years and is the author \n\nof some works which Canova was no ashamed to send out as his own. Five years ago a desire to roam and to raise some monument of \n\nhis skill in the new world brought him to the United States. He was engaged by the govt. here to execute an emblematical figure of the \n\ngenius of the Constitution for the Capital. He proceeded so far as to complete the model in plaster and as we do most things by halves \n\nwhich costs money. The expense of executing the work in marble prevented its being finished and the young man was forced to place \n\nthe plaster figure with all its imperfections in the hall in a most unfavorable position, forty feet from the floor��_He has also designed and \n\nexecuted for the govt. in plaster a model in acto relievo of the landing of Columbus, but as we were about to say while govts are coming \n\nto decisions life runs out and artists die in despair. We fear he will be disappointed or become wearied with waiting on the slow \n\nmovements of Congress��_Canova is now an old man quite infirm. He is represented as aricious and will not decline any work which is \n\noffered to him, but he does little but furnish to the inferior artist the model and gives some finishing touches��_\n\n","thing_uuid":"{E2F3C3CC-B014-45D8-8DC3-3C28DA0E18E4}","objects_refno":"2012.05.08.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.05.08.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Noah, Mordecai M","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"3/8/1822","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Letter from the publishers Gales and Seaton to newspaper editor, playwright and city sheriff, Mordecai M.

It gives a rare insight into the forces behind a synagogue move. The petition outlines their request and the logic behind it in seeking approval to sell property in Elm St_�_the points made is 1. several nuisances in vicinity machine shops have caused chief supporters in congregation to move up town, 2. Unless B'nei Jeshurun moves up town they will build new building for themselves, 3. The current building is in poor repair and requires nearly three thousand dollars to put it in proper condition, 4. They have an offer for the building of $18,000 allowing the 7,000 mortgage to be paid off and 5. the vote of the board was unanimously resolved to supply for power to sell.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1825, Bnai Jeshurun was the second synagogue founded in New York and the third oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in the United States. The synagogue was founded by a coalition of young members of congregation Shearith Israel and immigrants and the descendants of immigrants from the German and Polish lands. It was the stated intention to follow the German and Polish minhag (rite). The order of prayers followed that of the Ashkenazi Great Synagogue of London and sought the guidance of the British chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell on matters of ritual. The congregation dedicated its first building on Elm Street in Manhattan in 1827. In 1828, at a time of rapid growth in the New York Jewish community, a group left B'nai Jeshurun to found Ansche Chesed. The first rabbi, Samuel Isaacs, was appointed in 1839. By 1850, the congregation had grown large enough to make it necessary to build a new synagogue on Green Street. The petition above deals with the proposed move to Green Street.\n\n\n\n In 1865, the congregation moved yet again, to a new building on 34th Street, part of the site of the flagship Macy's store. and, driven by the rapid expansion of the city, yet again in 1885 to Madison Avenue at 65th Street. That building was designed by Rafael Guastavino and Schwarzmann & Buchman. The present building, located at 257 West 88th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue was dedicated in 1917. It was designed by Henry B. Herts, a congregant and celebrated theater architect, with Walter S. Schneider. It was later led by the famous Rabbi Stephen Wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..... B'Nai Jeshurun is a Manhattan\n\nsynagogue founded in 1825. The congregation grew until, by 1850, it\n\nneeded to build a new synagogue on Green Street. \n\n\n\nIt was later led by the famous rabbi Stephen Wise.\n\n\n\n\n May 1850. New York. An autograph document concerning the move of B'Nai Jeshurun in 1850: In matter\n\nof petition B'Nai Jeshurun of the City of New York_�_Get power to sell property in Elm St for the following reasons - there has\n\nbecome several nuisances in vicinity machine shops &c chief supporters in congregation have moved up town, & say that unless\n\nwe move up town they will build one for themselves.

An authentic document of that 1823 era. Although unsigned, the sole identifying feature are the two words at top of first page which appear to be name of famous N.Y. synagogue SHEARITH ISRAEL (just that first word is subject to interpretation).\n\n\n\n The five lengthy pages (in a small neat hand with many crossed out and altered words and changes in that same hand) opens: (as per my discussions with Prof. Arthur Kiron of the University of Penn, Presiding Elder refers to the President or Parmas eg the Lay Leader. This would squarely place the writer as Harmon Hendricks, the Parnas from 1824-27. September 1823 would have been the beginning of the new term):\n\n\n\n APPOINTED BY YOUR SUFFRAGES to perform the duties of Presiding Elder I avail myself of my induction into office to make a few brief observations. I consider it a favorable presage of the future, that during the past year, I have witnessed a great degree of serious deportment when assembled to offer up your adorations to that being, who has preserved you and by whose permission you appear again in his presence. Moved by the same passions, governed by the same inclinations that influence other men, I imputed that to you, a greater degree of levity than is manifested by any other congregated body. The peculiarity of your customs is calculated to excite observation and the paucity of your numbers render you more conspicuous. In every small community individual misconduct is identified with the society, whilst the good actions of its members are always forgotten. Hence, it behooves you to be circumspect to an extreme. Every religious assembly affords at times occasion to regret to those who feel an interest in the due observance of that line of conduct which will procure both the favor of God and man. CUSTOM HAS ESTABLISHED A CHANTING MODE OF PERFORMING YOUR DEVOTIONS. This is calculated to produce discord unless due attention is paid to modulating the voice and sounds become more confused by being conveyed in a language not in common use, yet with a little care that discord ceases and its idiom is proved susceptible to affording harmony [much more following about how to conduct themselves in prayer so as to be less disagreeable to others].\n\n\n\nHe continues at length the discussion of manner in which they are best to conduct themselves and to enjoy the best from their lives in religious observance and asks the question, which he answers: What infinite importance does this reflection give to the span of human life. A due consideration of these points will not only render you attentive to the duties attached to this place but will lead you also to consider the values of pious practices and reverential deportment. Be not deceived by the delusive calls which assail you on every side, but resolutely and wisely determine to pursue that course which will recommend you to Almighty God and induce his blessings let not the seducing smiles and flattering blandishments of prosperity or the scourge of adversity ever induce you to forget or relax in the pursuit of your real eternal interest [urging them to pursue the observance of the holy laws and engage with others and the world about them to acquire their lasting benefits. As well as to enjoy the privileges of the laws of the country in which they lived i.e. America] BE ISRAELITES NOT ONLY A NAME BUT IN DEED let due adherence to moral rectitude distinguish your intercourse with the world it will render you useful, respected and happy. Consider how much is to be done and how short, at best, and always how uncertain is the period allowed you to perform it in. AT THIS SEASON when you look for forgiveness [Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur about to arrive] when you look for forgiveness OF TRESPASSES will it not be well to examine your course bury in oblivion the trifling injuries you have received take your brother by the hand and forget existing differences and unite in good will [and more of personal relationship with God:]harbour not in your heart ill will to your fellow man may it not be well in your retired moments to reflect on these important truths?\n\n\n\nHendricks was the great copper baron\n\n\n\nMay be the eariest known American Parmas speech.

He was a pilot and was shot down 2/19/1937 fighting Fascism. The archive includes a 13 page booklet with his story, The Flying Reporter (vol.1 No.3) issued by the Ben Leider Memorial Committee (3/1938), the printed press release of his death, a broadside of his death that shows letter and news paper reports, a photo of him with friends, a love letter by Ben Leider (1/24/1931)to S. Marshak at Cornell University and a second love letter to S. Marshak (circa 1935).\n\n\n\nBenjamin Leider was born in Kishinev, Russia in 1901. Many of his relatives were killed in the 1905 Kishinev massacre carried out by the Czarist regime against the Jews in Russia. The Leider family was helped by a Christian butcher who hid the family in his home. In 1905, his family came to America and settled in Brooklyn where his father worked chipping mortar from second-hand bricks. He graduated from Brooklyn Commercial High School where he ran track and cross-country, wrestled, and wrote for the school newspaper. Afterwards, he attended City College where he wrote for the campus student newspaper. After two years, he transferred to the journalism school of the University of Missouri.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from college, Ben took a job as a reporter with the New York Graphic where he worked for five years. In the late 1920s, Ben became interested in aviation. He borrowed money and bought a second-hand plane, became an expert pilot, received his license from the Department of Commerce and branched out into aerial photography. In 1930, Leider went to work for the New York News Association, a reporting service for the city's newspapers, where he covered the miners' strike in Harlan County, Kentucky. From 1932 to 1933 Ben worked on a WPA project, studying slum housing and slum clearance - a subject on which he was to become expert in while working at the New York Post. He joined the staff of the New York Post in 1934 as a flying reporter. While working for the New York Post, Benjamin was a charter member and an organizer of the New York Newspaper Guild. He also became the first aerial picket in labor history. In the Guild's first strike action, against the Long Island Press, he painted a huge Join the Guild sign on his plane and flew low over the publisher's roof.\n\n\n\nLeider enlisted in the Spanish Loyalist air force in September 1936 under the pseudonym Jose Lando. He piloted a transport plane that transported officers and arms, flying from Valencia to Albacete, Alicante and Madrid. In February 1937, he was sent to combat school for special training for fighter pilots. He was assigned to the squadron at Alcala de Henares just north of Madrid. Benjamin Leider died on February 19, 1937 in Madrid when his airplane was shot down while fighting on the Jarama front. He was the first American to be killed while fighting in the Spanish Civil War. A memorial service was held for him in August 1938 at Carnegie Hall with 3,000 people in attendance. Speakers at the service included his brother D. William Leider; Rockwell Kent, president of the American Artists' Union; Carl Radau, president of the New York Newspaper Guild, and Frank O'Flaherty, a veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. A children's colony in Eastern Spain, La Casa Ben Leider - founded to house children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War - was named in his honor. In 1938, the children in this colony created a book of drawings for Ben Leider's family. He is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{7968E2BC-83E3-4F7D-BC47-7FFCB147B8FE}","objects_refno":"2012.03.18.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.03.18.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Leider, Ben","objects_objtype":"Archive","objects_date":"2/19/1937","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Post.Civil War","descript_1":"An archive on Ben Leider, the first American volunteer to be killed in the Spanish Revolution of 1937.

Roosevelt and must pay up by 7/7/1810 at an interest rate of 7%......signed at bottom by Ephraim Hart and Francis Arden.....multiple signatures of James C. Roosevelt as having received partial payments from Hart. It is witnessed on third page by Absalom Nelson and Samuel Gedney. As per the document ( 8x12 and 3 pages), by 1812 Hart is insolvent, cannot complete payments and Roosevelt takes procession in such a manner that that Hart can take advantage of the Insolvent Act.\n\n\n\nEphraim Hart (1747 - July 16, 1825) was an American merchant who helped to organize the Board of Stock-Brokers, now known as the New York Stock Exchange. Hart was born in F�_rth, a city in the region of Franconia which lies now in Bavaria, Germany. Since 1440, a prospering Jewish community existed in F�_rth. Hart's original surname was Hirz which he changed when he came to the United States.\n\n \n\nBy 1782 he was residing as a merchant in Philadelphia, and in that year he joined the Mickvթ Israel congregation. He married in 1783 Frances Noah, a sister of Manuel Noah, and their son was Joel Hart. Later he removed to New York and engaged in the commission and brokerage business. On April 2, 1787, he was registered as an elector of the Shearith Israel congregation. \n\n\n\nBy 1792 he had become one of the most successful merchants in the City, and at this time he helped to organize the Board of Stock-Brokers, now known as the New York Stock Exchange. His name appears in 1799 in a list of owners of houses and lots valued at �2,000 or more. He was one of the founders, in 1802, of the ebra Hesed Veemet, a charitable organization connected with the Shearith Israel congregation. He died in New York City.\n\n\n\nThe history of the New York Stock Exchange begins with the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement by twenty-four New York City stockbrokers and merchants on May 17, 1792, outside at 68 Wall Street under a Buttonwood tree. In the beginning there were five securities traded in New York City with the first listed company on the NYSE being the Bank of New York.

This port of entry document is fromHendricks & Brothers. shipping finished copper to Hartford, Connecticut\n\n\n\n1 of 5\n\n\n\nThe Hendricks family of New York helped lay the foundation for the Industrial Revolution in America. Their pioneering production of copper was vital to the growth of the American economy and the nation's military might. When the company closed in 1938, Hendricks Brothers was the oldest continuous privately held Jewish family business in the United States.\n\n\n\nUriah Hendricks, the patriarch of the family, was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1737 and emigrated from London to New York City in 1755. In New York, he opened a dry goods store and became an active member, and eventually parnas, or president, of Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. The congregation served as the unifying institution of the New York Jewish community, which numbered about 200 people. In 1764, Hendricks established a metals business, importing copper and brass from England, which discouraged manufacture of these commodities in the American colonies. On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928. Hendricks Brothers closed its last copper mill in 1938.\n\n\n\nJust as Harmon Hendricks was able to build a business that his descendants maintained, he was able to continue a tradition of religious commitment that his father, Uriah, had bequeathed to him. Each of Harmon's children found a spouse among the families at Shearith Israel. Son Henry joined his father-in-law, Tobias I. Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz. In 1852, Henry Hendricks and eight others founded Jews' Hospital, now Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, the oldest Jewish medical institution in the United States.\n\n\n\nIsaac Leeser, editor of The Occident, the leading American Jewish newspaper of the pre-Civil War era, was often critical of what he considered the aloof and uncharitable attitudes of the Sephardic grandees. To quote Maxwell Whiteman, however, Leeser singled out the liberality of the Hendricks family as an exception ��_ Modesty and reserve continued to govern the family attitude in matters of philanthropy, and the practice of keeping such activity from the public eye, begun by Harmon Hendricks, was maintained by his descendants.\n\n\n\nIn the same low-key and generous manner, the Hendricks family descendants continue to be active in Shearith Israel and in Jewish communal life today.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{4147A492-21C6-457E-8076-F6BD133E311B}","objects_refno":"2008.08.25.00023","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.25.00023","objects_customfield_5":"Hendricks & Brothers","objects_objtype":"PORT OF ENTRY","objects_date":"4///12/1836","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Port of entry document from Hendricks and Brothers, shipping finished copper to Charleston, South Carolina","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Hendricks and Brothers","merger":"Hendricks and Brothers","location":"New York, NY","date":"1836-04-12T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NYC 863","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_863_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_863_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1448,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref3632","ref_2":"cid4638428","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Ports of entry","descriptio":"Hendricks & Isaacs (his brother-in-law) founded Soho Copper Refinery in Soho, New Jersey.

Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks.

Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world.

On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928.

Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz.

Their pioneering production of copper was vital to the growth of the American economy and the nation's military might. When the company closed in 1938, Hendricks Brothers was the oldest continuous privately held Jewish family business in the United States.\n\n\n\nUriah Hendricks, the patriarch of the family, was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1737 and emigrated from London to New York City in 1755. In New York, he opened a dry goods store and became an active member, and eventually parnas, or president, of Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. The congregation served as the unifying institution of the New York Jewish community, which numbered about 200 people. In 1764, Hendricks established a metals business, importing copper and brass from England, which discouraged manufacture of these commodities in the American colonies. On his death, Uriah's only son Harmon took over the metals importing company, as well as the family role in leading Shearith Israel, where he too served as parnas from 1824 to 1827.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the United States could never attain true independence so long as it was dependent on overseas production of essential products such as copper, Harmon Hendricks helped transform the United States from an importer to a manufacturer of copper. In 1812, during the American war with England, Hendricks and his brother-in-law Solomon Isaacs built one of the nation's first successful copper rolling mills in Soho, New Jersey. Historian Maxwell Whiteman observed that Hendricks became his own metallurgist at a time when the secrets of the science of refining metals were jealously guarded by the English. Because of his skill, Hendricks made possible the use of copper rather than iron in the manufacture of steam boilers, a development that allowed boilers to be heated to higher temperatures without cracking.\n\n\n\nOne of Hendricks's most important copper customers was Paul Revere, the famous patriot and metalsmith who lived in Boston and who became a friend. The American Jewish Historical Society's archives contain letters between the two men. Another good customer was the fledgling United States Navy. The Hendricks firm produced the copper used to sheath three Navy vessels in New York harbor at the same time that Revere was cladding a fourth, the Constitution, now ironically known as Old Ironsides, with copper probably supplied by Hendricks. These copper-clad ships helped the United States fight the British to a standstill in the War of 1812. Hendricks made another contribution to the war effort by subscribing the then-considerable sum of $40,000 to government issued war bonds.\n\n\n\nRobert Fulton, who is credited with inventing the steamship, was another frequent customer of Harmon Hendricks's copper. In the spring of 1807, Hendricks supplied the copper used to build the boiler for the Clermont, the first inland steam driven packet boat in the world. The shipping of goods and passengers by Fulton's steamships and their successors dominated interstate travel and commerce until the invention of the railroad.\n\n\n\nWhen Harmon Hendricks died in 1838, he had helped transform American industry. His advocacy of the use of copper in shipbuilding made America a naval power. His technical knowledge, engineering skill and willingness to invest in advanced techniques of copper manufacture set a standard for American industrial innovation. His three sons and four grandsons succeeded him in the business. The last member of the family to operate the business was Harmon Washington Hendricks, who died in 1928. Hendricks Brothers closed its last copper mill in 1938.\n\n\n\nJust as Harmon Hendricks was able to build a business that his descendants maintained, he was able to continue a tradition of religious commitment that his father, Uriah, had bequeathed to him. Each of Harmon's children found a spouse among the families at Shearith Israel. Son Henry joined his father-in-law, Tobias I. Tobias, as an officer of one of the earliest Jewish charities, the Society for the Education of Poor Children and Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion, which was founded in 1827. In `833, Henry joined his brother-in-law, Benjamin Nathan, as a founder of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which was modeled after a similar organization established in Philadelphia by Rebecca Gratz.

It was an instant success and Belmont was able to straighten out the Rothschild interests in the U.S. between 1837 and 1842.

His family was Jewish, but outwardly professed Christianity because of the continuous persecutions of the Inquisition, and he was baptized under the name of Duarte Lopez. Between 1748 and 1750, most of the Aaron's family settled in Newport, Rhode Island, known for religious tolerance. Aaron, his wife and his daughter joined them in 1752. \n\n\n\nOver the next twenty years, Aaron was a major force in making Newport both the leading Jewish community in America, and also the second-largest mercantile port (after New York City). He was instrumental in founding the Touro Synagogue, the first in the colonies. He was also a pioneer in the spermaceti industry, and engaged in a wide variety of mercantile activities, including the slave trade. \n\n\n\nLopez's business was ruined by the American Revolution. Along with many Newport merchants, Lopez had somewhat of a reputation for Tory leanings. His merchant ships were preyed upon by both sides in the conflict. Furthermore, the British occupation of the town and the general devastation of the war finished Newport as a leading port city. During much of the war, Lopez lived in Leicester, near Worcester, Massachusetts. After the British had been driven from Newport in 1782, Lopez set out to help rebuild his home city, but never made it back; he drowned in a pond while tending to his horse.\n\n Receipt (Judaica) - Signed receipt by Aaron Lopez bill for 250 bushels of salt from his store to William Vernon &; Sammuel Vernon....The Vernons_�_ were the largest slavers of the Colonial era. ,,,,4/26/1771\n\n\n\nDuarte Lopez was born in 1731 in Lisbon, Portugal. He belonged to a family of conversos who professed Catholicism while they continued to practice Judaism in secret. In 1750 Lopez married a woman named Anna, and within two years the couple had a daughter, Catherine.  In 1752 Duarte and his family moved to Newport, where they lived as Jews and became Aaron, Abigail, and Sarah.\n\n\n\nBy the early 1770s, Lopez had become the wealthiest person in Newport; his tax assessment was twice that of any other resident. The reason he was successful was that his business interests were so diverse. He manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, and chocolate. He had business interests in the production of textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles. Ezra Stiles, the Congregational minister in Newport and future president of Yale College, described Lopez as a merchant of the first eminence and wrote that the extent of [his] commerce probably [was] surpassed by no merchant in America\n\n\n\nLopez supported a number of charitable causes in Newport. He purchased books for the Redwood Library and Athenaeum. He contributed lumber to help build the College of Rhode Island (which later relocated to Providence and eventually became Brown University), and he donated land to establish Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts. Lopez was a leading contributor who helped build the Touro Synagogue, and he was given the honor of laying one of its cornerstones.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1770s, with growing tensions between Britain and its American colonies, Lopez's fortunes began to decline. The Continental Association enforced a boycott against trade with Britain. In October 1775, the British navy anchored outside Newport's harbor and the population began to evacuate the city. In early 1776 Lopez relocated to Portsmouth, Rhode Island; then to Providence, Boston, and finally to Leicester, Massachusetts.

Under the British Naturalization Act of 1740, anyone who had resided in the colony for seven years could become a British citizen, regardless of religion. Although they met the conditions set by law, the request was denied. Lopez and Elizer appealed to the Rhode Island General Assembly. The lower house approved their request and required that the men return to the Superior Court to take an oath of allegiance, but the terms of their citizenship would be limited: Jews could become citizens of Rhode Island, but they would not be allowed to vote or serve in public office.\n\n\n\nLopez and Elizer fared worse in the upper house of the legislature. There they were told that Parliament had given the courts, not the legislature, jurisdiction over naturalization. If they wished to become citizens, Lopez and Elizer would have to appeal to the Superior Court. The Superior Court heard the pair's appeal on March 11, 1762. Their application was denied a second time. The court reasoned that the 1740 act was intended to increase the population of the colony, and since the colony had grown crowded the law no longer applied. The court also noted that under a 1663 Rhode Island law, only Christians could become citizens. Lopez and Elizer could not become citizens of Rhode Island. On 7/23/1763, Isaac Elizer was naturalized in NYC.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{77FEC1B3-59BE-4DF8-953B-C02E50ACF923}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03222","objects_customfield_6":"U. S. JEWERY 1776.1985 VOL.

Document is entirely in the hand of Lopez, with a great flourishing signature. \n\n\n\nAaron Lopez was born in Portugal in 1731. His family was Jewish, but outwardly professed Christianity because of the continuous persecutions of the Inquisition, and he was baptized under the name of Duarte Lopez. Between 1748 and 1750, most of the Aaron's family settled in Newport, Rhode Island, known for religious tolerance. Aaron, his wife and his daughter joined them in 1752. \n\n\n\nOver the next twenty years, Aaron was a major force in making Newport both the leading Jewish community in America, and also the second-largest mercantile port (after New York City). He was instrumental in founding the Touro Synagogue, the first in the colonies. He was also a pioneer in the spermaceti industry, and engaged in a wide variety of mercantile activities, including the slave trade.\n\n\n\nLopez's business was ruined by the American Revolution. Along with many Newport merchants, Lopez had somewhat of a reputation for Tory leanings. His merchant ships were preyed upon by both sides in the conflict. Furthermore, the British occupation of the town and the general devastation of the war finished Newport as a leading port city. During much of the war, Lopez lived in Leicester, near Worcester, Massachusetts. After the British had been driven from Newport in 1782, Lopez set out to help rebuild his home city, but never made it back; he drowned in a pond while tending to his horse.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2A950DFB-7548-4695-A0CA-482F1266D0F7}","objects_refno":"2010.01.10.00002","objects_customfield_6":"2010.01.10.00002","objects_customfield_5":"Lopez, Aaron","objects_objtype":"Receipt","objects_date":"7/13/1763","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Lopez, Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Lopez, Aaron","location":"Newport, RI","date":"1763-07-13T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"RI 523","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ri_523_1r.tif; doc_ja_ri_523_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.312828,41.4901]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1675,"longitude":-71.31282841,"latitude":41.49009956,"ref_1":"ref3817","ref_2":"cid4638245","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Receipts","descriptio":"Ledger Sheet (Judaica) _�_ This sheet written on two sides (12_�_ x 8_�) in Newport, Rhode Island was the account of purchases by Samuel and William Vernon to/from Aaron Lopez. The 25 transactions cover the periods 6/23/1766 to 3/24/1767 and include a reconciliation and final payment due. It looks as if 11,010 pounds sterling were purchases by Lopez of West Indies Rum, tea and linseed oil and mostly candles purchased from Lopez for 8344 pounds sterling for a balance owed of 2665 pound sterling. A fine detailed record of commerce between two of the wealthiest men in the Colonies. \n\n\n\nDuarte Lopez was born in 1731 in Lisbon, Portugal. He belonged to a family of conversos who professed Catholicism while they continued to practice Judaism in secret. In 1750 Lopez married a woman named Anna, and within two years the couple had a daughter, Catherine.  In 1752 Duarte and his family moved to Newport, where they lived as Jews and became Aaron, Abigail, and Sarah.\n\n\n\nBy the early 1770s, Lopez had become the wealthiest person in Newport; his tax assessment was twice that of any other resident. The reason he was successful was that his business interests were so diverse. He manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, and chocolate. He had business interests in the production of textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles. Ezra Stiles, the Congregational minister in Newport and future president of Yale College, described Lopez as a merchant of the first eminence and wrote that the extent of [his] commerce probably [was] surpassed by no merchant in America\n\n\n\nLopez supported a number of charitable causes in Newport. He purchased books for the Redwood Library and Athenaeum. He contributed lumber to help build the College of Rhode Island (which later relocated to Providence and eventually became Brown University), and he donated land to establish Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts. Lopez was a leading contributor who helped build the Touro Synagogue, and he was given the honor of laying one of its cornerstones.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1770s, with growing tensions between Britain and its American colonies, Lopez's fortunes began to decline. The Continental Association enforced a boycott against trade with Britain. In October 1775, the British navy anchored outside Newport's harbor and the population began to evacuate the city. In early 1776 Lopez relocated to Portsmouth, Rhode Island; then to Providence, Boston, and finally to Leicester, Massachusetts. Historian Marilyn Kaplan describes Lopez's losses during the American Revolution as monumental.\n\n\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Lopez harbored Jewish refugees in his Leicester home. Referring to those sheltered by Lopez, a friend wrote in jest that your family at present are in a number only 99 and still there is room for one more\n\n\n\nOn May 28, 1782, while returning with his family from Leicester to Newport, Lopez drowned when his horse and carriage fell into a pond\n\n\n\nThe Vernon brothers, William and Samuel, made a name for themselves in Newport by successfully utilizing the triangle trade. Their first ship, commanded by Captain John Godfrey, was ironically named the Olive Branch. The brothers also owned the Hare, a ship whose participation in the American slave trade is well documented. Incredible profits were made by purchasing slaves in Africa with rum from the colonies, selling those slaves in the West Indies, using those profits to purchase molasses from those ports before buying more rum in the colonies, continuing the triangular cycle of trade.\n\n\n\nThe Vernons are known as the first Newport merchants to sell African slaves directly to the southern colonies, instead of exclusively in the West Indies. Their ships returning from the West Indies offloaded slaves in South Carolina in exchange for barrels of rice destined for markets in New England. Their first sale to the southern colonies was made in Charleston in 1755. These brothers serve as a perfect example of the pivotal role many northern colonies played in the American slave trade \n\n","thing_uuid":"{B9820066-9004-4C13-87C0-F09829E7F590}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02864","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02864","objects_customfield_5":"LOPEZ, AARON (1731.1782)","objects_objtype":"Receipt","objects_date":"3/24/1767","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Lopez, Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Lopez, Aaron","location":"Newport, RI","date":"1767-03-24T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana Oversize","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"56","tiff_locat":"doc_jal_56_1r.tif; doc_jal_56_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.312828,41.4901]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1676,"longitude":-71.31282841,"latitude":41.49009956,"ref_1":"ref3818","ref_2":"cid4638244","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Receipts","descriptio":"Insurance (Judaica) - Request for insurance on 4 kegs of furs on board Hope, bound from Providence, Rhode Island to London by Moses David and Jacob Lopez circa 1770.

W. Harper brand of bourbon distilled at the Bernheim distillery in Louisville, Kentucky. The success of his distillery and distribution business helped to consolidate the Louisville area as a major centre of Kentucky bourbon distilling. \n\nIsaac Bernheim was born in Schmieheim, now part of Kippenheim in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1867 with $4 in his pocket. He originally planned to work in New York City. However, the company where he wanted to work went bankrupt, and he was forced to follow a different line of work. He became a traveling salesman or peddler travelling throughout Pennsylvania on horseback selling household items to housewives and made a respectable living. However, he was forced to stop peddling when his horse died.\n\nFollowing the death of his horse Bernheim moved to Paducah, Kentucky where he worked as a bookkeeper for a wholesale liquor company, Loeb, Bloom, & Co. He was able to save money to bring his brother Bernard to America. He quickly moved on however, and with the help of Nathan Uri and his brother, Bernard Bernheim, was able to open up his own liquor sales firm called Bernheim Brothers & Uri in 1872. Mr. Uri was the brother of IW Bernheim's wife, Amanda. Because of their business's proximity to large waterways, the company grew rapidly.\n\n\n\nBernheim Brothers & Uri moved from Paducah to Louisville in 1889 for the purchase of a distillery in New Haven. In 1896 Bernheim Brothers & Uri bought the Pleasure Ridge Park Distillery and renamed it Bernheim Distillery Co. Following the purchase of this distillery, they began the production of an elite whiskey brand called I.W. Harper. Bernheim sold the business to the Schenley Distilling Corporation in 1937. Bernheim Brothers Distillery was one of only ten distilleries given permission to continue to make bourbon for medicinal purposes.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{073C8FF1-38C6-43A4-9DA2-2140F5C3CD4D}","objects_refno":"2010.08.29.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.08.29.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Bernheim Brothers","objects_objtype":"Letterhead","objects_date":"1/10/1876","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"This is an early commerical letter from Bernheim Brothers in Paducah Kenturcky, dated January 10th, 1876","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Bernheim Brothers","merger":"Bernheim Brothers","location":"Paducah, KY","date":"1876-01-10T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"KY 118","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ky_118_1r.tif; doc_ja_ky_118_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.637576,29.648577]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1719,"longitude":-81.63757622,"latitude":29.64857685,"ref_1":"ref885","ref_2":"cid4641159","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"Lemon Street","thing_uuid":"{B4375193-1A5D-4EF3-8ECD-EAC9E6F8E9EF}","objects_refno":"2008.08.12.00004","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.12.00004","objects_customfield_5":"Loeb, Marcus","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"7/1/1887","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Billhead for Marcus Loeb","person_nam":"Loeb, Marcus","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Loeb, Marcus","location":"Palatka, FL","date":"1887-07-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Post-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"GA 180","tiff_locat":"doc_bhl_ga_180_1r.tif; doc_bhl_ga_180_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.637576,29.648577]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1720,"longitude":-81.63757622,"latitude":29.64857685,"ref_1":"ref2814","ref_2":"cid4639240","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Letter (Judaica) _�_ A one page commercial letter (10/2/1851) by M. E. Levy re: land in Levy County. It was written from  Pilatka, Florida.  A pioneerJewish settler of Florida, he came in 1821. He was a visionary exponent of Jewish colonization and educational schemes. Signed documents by this famous pioneer are scarce.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Morocco in 1781, Moses E. Levy was the son of a Moroccan government minister. After the Sultan_�_s death in 1790, Morocco experienced an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence and the Levy family fled to Gibraltar. There, at the age of 15, while praying at a synagogue, Levy had a revelation, he later wrote, surpassing the idea of hellfire A according to historian Chris Monaco, During this episode . . . Moses Levy _��swore never to doubt the Bible._�_ While most of 19th-century American Jewry took a lax approach to religious observance, Levy remained staunchly traditional, keeping the Sabbath and observing kashrut. In 1800, the death of Levy_�_s father and a yellow fever epidemic forced Moses, his mother and his infant sister to leave Gibraltar for the Danish Virgin Islands, where they joined a thriving Jewish community. Three years later, at age 22, he became partners in a lumber business with Philip Benjamin, father of U.S. Senator and Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. Levy subsequently moved to Puerto Rico, where he became a munitions contractor and, after separating from his wife, moved to Cuba, where he built a fortune in shipping.\n\n\n\nWhile in Cuba, Levy decided to use his wealth to purchase a tract of land near Micopany in Spanish Florida, which was soon ceded to the United States. Levy built houses and dug wells in hopes of attracting European Jews living under oppressive conditions. Jews in the Diaspora needed a homeland, he observed, because no amelioration can be expected at the hands of nations for us. He argued, The race of Jews has miraculously been continued unmixed with the people of the nations through which they have been scattered and warned that every Jew who contributes to the . . . amalgamation of the House of Israel is an enemy to his nation, his religion and, consequently, to the world at large. He named his colony Pilgrimage Plantation. Between 1820 and 1824, Levy traveled north to New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk to seek financial support for his plan. Yet, by 1825, few Jews had emigrated from Europe to the wilds of Levy_�_s experimental plantation. Perhaps the fact that hostile Indians, snakes and alligators inhabited Florida discouraged settlers.\n\n\n\nIn 1825, Levy traveled to London, hoping to persuade Jewish philanthropists there to support Pilgrimage Plantation. His pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. Through his willingness to address leading English Christians, however, Levy had an impact on the campaign to reestablish full Jewish rights in England. In 1826, a number of upper-class Christian Londoners took a genuine interest, on liberal grounds, in restoring full political equality to England_�_s Jews, whose rights had been suspended 500 years earlier. Levy addressed reform-minded Christian groups on a number of occasions and impressed them with his learning. The sophisticated yet pious Levy helped dispel the notion among affluent Londoners that all Jews were peddlers living in poverty in London_�_s East End.\n\n\n\nLevy also confronted the evangelical London Society for the Promotion of Christianity among the Jews, challenging their attempts to save the Jewish people through conversion. Ironically, Levy_�_s contacts with evangelicals, whom he opposed on conversion, gave him a voice in the British antislavery movement. Levy had lived with slavery in the Caribbean and Florida. He was listened to with rapt attention on the subject by the leading group of British evangelical abolitionists was known as the Clapham Sect. Because Levy observed the Sabbath, spoke fluent Hebrew and knew the Bible, the Claphamites respected Levy as a lineal descendant of the ancient Hebrews, whose religion, they believed, was the wellspring of Christianity. British abolitionists advocated for immediate emancipation to save the souls of both slave and slave owner. Levy argued that, first, banks and businesses would have to be created to invest in non-slave agriculture and the children of slaves would have to be educated in agricultural techniques. Levy thought it would require a generation of gradual preparation for emancipation. Despite these reservations, Levy was one of the few individuals living in the American South to propose emancipation _�_even if he was in the relative safety of London when he made his views public.\n\n\n\nIronically, little that Levy stood for survived his own lifetime. In 1835, Pilgrimage Plantation was burned during the Second Seminole War. Levy_�_s son, David Levy Yulee, later became a United States Senator from Florida, the first Jewish-born American so elected. Contrary to his father, the younger Levy remained pro-slavery and rejected his Jewish identity. Nevertheless, Moses Elias Levy proved a visionary in predicting that, one day, Florida would make an excellent home for Diaspora Jews to settle in.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2F0C0959-0D63-4942-87C0-41AD87FEB1D8}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02583","objects_customfield_6":"NUMEROUS","objects_customfield_5":"LEVY, MOSES ELIAS (1782.1854)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"10/2/1851","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"A signed one page commercial letter written by Moses Elias Levy (1782-1854) in Miconopy, Florida, regarding land in Levy County.

In 1844, Thomas Reaney, Jacob Neafie and William Smith formed a\n\npartnership in Philadelphia, PA, to build fire engines, boilers and stationary\n\nsteam engines. However, in that year they also launched four iron steamboats\n\ndestined for export to South America (Morrison, 1905). Smith died in 1845,\n\n\n\nCapt. John P. Levy was invited to join the firm. While Neafie and Levy\n\nwere experienced mechanics, their social connections and financial resources\n\nwere limited. Levy brought connections and money from his shipping\n\nactivities, which facilitated the firm's subsequent expansion. \n\n\n\nIn 1859, Reaney left the firm and established a yard in Chester, PA, in partnership with his son.From then on it was Neafie & Levy, until it closed in 1907.

Dropsie, Isaac Hyneman, Jacob Langsdorff, Isaac Leeser, L. J. Leberman, Joseph Newhouse, and H. Polock, Managers. The election being over, the subjoined report of the President, who is absent in England, was presented and read; and, on motion, was sent to the Occident for insertion. The feeling report of our President proves that his heart is with us, though absent in person; and we hope that his sentiments may produce, as they richly deserve, more than a passing impression on our readers, especially of those who are confederated in the same cause.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2E407DE9-1468-42A0-914E-9B31B5FF1F33}","objects_refno":"2012.02.05.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2012.02.05.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Solis, Solomon da Silva (3/14/1819 - 5/24/1854)","objects_objtype":"Billhead","objects_date":"12/8/1854","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Billhead listing books and magazines purchased by Mr. Solomon da Silva Solis (1819-1854), founder of the first American Jewish Publication Society and of the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia, for the library of the Hebrew Education Society of Phi","person_nam":"Solis, Solomon Da Silva","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Solis, Solomon Da Silva","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1854-12-08T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHIL 86","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_86_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_86_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1811,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref1234","ref_2":"cid4640811","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"Mfg. of Shirts, Bosoms and Collars\n\n\n\nN.W.

He married Miriam Binswanger on 10 February 1874; they had nine children. Cohen died in Philadelphia on 22 December 1927.\n\n\n\nCohen attended lectures at Jefferson Medical College (1857-1858), then traveled to Memphis, Tennessee. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he entered the University of Pennsylvania and received his M.D. in 1860. He served a brief residency at the Pennsylvania Hospital, but resigned due to the Civil War. During the war, Cohen served as Assistant Surgeon to the 26th Pennsylvania Regiment (1861), Acting Assistant Surgeon to the United States Navy (1861-1864), and, finally, Visiting Surgeon to army hospitals in Philadelphia until the war's end.\n\n\n\nIn 1866, Cohen opened his private practice in Philadelphia; he concentrated on diseases of the throat and chest. In 1867, he became the first American to perform a successful laryngotomy for removal of a cancerous growth, although he opposed this operation because of its high risks. Cohen also performed the first closed field laryngotomy in 1892. He had a strong interest in tuberculosis as well.\n\n\n\nIn 1866, Cohen established regularly organized lectures in laryngology at the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. In the following year, he assumed the post of Lecturer in Electrotherapeutics at Jefferson Medical College, then became Lecturer in Laryngoscopy and Diseases of the Chest in 1869. In 1882, Cohen helped to establish the Philadelphia Polyclinic and College for Graduates in Medicine and became Professor of Diseases of the Throat and Chest there. He was also Professor of Physiology at the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Visiting Physician to the German Hospital, Physician to St. Mary's Hospital, and Consulting Physician to the Jewish Hospital. An honorary professorship in laryngology was created for J. Solis Cohen at Jefferson in 1890-1891. By 1895, he had virtually retired from teaching.\n\n\n\nCohen published several works including Inhalation: its therapeutics and practice (1867); Diseases of the throat (1872); Diseases of the throat and nasal passages (1879); Croup and its relation to tracheotomy (1874); and The throat and the voice (1879).\n\n\n\nHe helped to establish the American Laryngological Association in 1878, served as President from 1880 to 1882, and edited Archives of laryngology in 1880. He was also\n\n\n\nPresident of the Northern Medical Association (1875) and the Philadelphia County Medical Society (1887-1888). Cohen became a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1871.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{12C0C967-1F58-45E1-892F-016EB090ED78}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00621","objects_customfield_6":"HISTORY JEWS OF PHILA.(TO 1840) BY M.

He was in this profession 1839.1848 before studying law. The Collection hoses his journals as a watch maker. \n\nBiographical Sketch: Born in Philadelphia on March 9, 1821 to a Jewish father and a Christian mother, Moses Dropsie converted to Judaism at the age of fourteen along with his sister and brother in a formal ceremony featuring a ritual immersion in the Delaware River.\n\n\n\nDropsie worked as an apprentice to a watchmaker before pursuing a career in law at the age of twenty-eight. He made his fortune through his law practice and through investments in Philadelphia's street cars, becoming President of both the Lombard and South Street Railroads as well the Green and Coates Streets Railroad Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nDropsie has always taken a deep interest in Jewish charitable and educational work. He has been a director of the Hebrew Fuel Society; a member of the board of ad junta (directors) of the Sephardic Congregation Mickvթ Israel and was one of the charter members, and for more than forty years an officer, of the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia, having acted as secretary, vice-president, and (twice) president. He is now (1903) an honorary life-member of the board of officers. Dropsie was also president of Maimonides College from 1867 to 1873, and has been president of the Philadelphia branch of the Alliance Israթlite Universelle since 1883 and of Gratz College since its foundation in 1893. From 1856 to 1861 he was president of the Mercantile Club.\n\n\n\nHe has translated and edited Mackeldey's Handbook of the Roman Law (1883), and in addition has published (1892) a separate work on The Roman Law of Testaments, Codicils, and Gifts in the Event of Death (Mortis Causa Donationes). Dropsie was a protթgթ of Isaac Leeser and wrote Panegyric on the Life of the Rev. Isaac Leeser, The Life of Jesus from and Including the Accusation until the Alleged Resurrection, with an Account of the Cross-Crown of Thorns, and Reform Judaism and the Study of Hebrew.\n\n\n\n,\n\nUpon his death in 1905, Dropsie, a life-long bachelor, bequeathed his entire estate to the establishment of a College for the promotion of and instruction in the Hebrew and Cognate languages and their respective literatures. He further directed that there shall be no discrimination on account of creed, color or sex, in the criteria of admission to the College. So was born [Dropsie College,] this pioneering experiment in Jewish higher education planted in the soil of American democratic principles (Arthur Kiron). Dropsie was merged into the University of Pennsylvania (Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies).\n\n","thing_uuid":"{3D0D8CA2-452D-4CC4-8077-502AC4805D7A}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02143","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.02143","objects_customfield_5":"DROPSIE, MOSES AARON (1821.1905)","objects_objtype":"BROADSIDE","objects_date":"1/1/1845","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Broadside for Moses Dropsie's watch maker's shop","person_nam":"Dropsie, Moses Aaron","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Dropsie, Moses Aaron","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1845-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHIL 32","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_32_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_32_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_32_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_32_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1830,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref1429","ref_2":"cid4640618","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Broadsides","descriptio":"(1808 Jury List) Printed Broadside, 1p. 335x204 mm.

The combination of the principal charitable societies of Philadelphia was formed on March 17, 1901; Jacob Gimbel was its first president. The federation as originally formed embraced nine institutions-the Jewish Hospital Association, Jewish Foster Home, Society of United Hebrew Charities, Hebrew Education Society, Orphans' Guardians, Jewish Maternity Association, Jewish Immigration Society, Young Women's Union, and Hebrew Sunday-School Society. Later, the National Farm School, the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (at Denver), and the Alliance Israթlite Universelle became beneficiaries.

DROPSIE PERSONALLY docketed these sheets on the reverse of the last page, as a memento and keepsake for himself: MY FIRST ARGUMENT MADE WHEN I HAD BEEN READING LAW 9 MONTHS. Title of the document (all in Dropsie's hand) Argument in Thompson's creditors as Thompson's administrators before vice-Provost McCall, Oct. 17, 1849. (Dropsie was admitted to the Phila.

(Note: Although a photo static copy of the article was not located in time to accompany this description, it is noted that such an account has been personally seen in a printed work about Dropsie which makes specific mention of this exact document as being the first legal matter of his career!).  \n\n\n\nNo American Jewish personages achieved a more enduring reputation or played a more important role in American Judaism and few reached the equal of it as a philanthropist, patron of Jewish learning, businessman and attorney as this famed Philadelphian. He maintained an equally high profile in public affairs, strongly opposed slavery; instrumental in railway development, member and presiding officer of many Hebrew education societies and organizations; president of Maimonides College (1867-1873) and later Gratz College and the founder of a college named for him (and to this day carrying that same name) at the Univ. of Penna. \n\n\n\n _��Born in Philadelphia on March 9, 1821 to a Jewish father and a Christian mother, Dropsie converted to Judaism at the age of fourteen along with his sister and brother in a formal ceremony featuring a ritual immersion in the Delaware River.\n\n\n\n Dropsie worked as an apprentice to a watchmaker before pursuing a career in law at the age of twenty-eight. He made his fortune through his law practice and through investments in Philadelphia_�_s streetcars, becoming president of both the Lombard and South Street Railroads as well the Green and Coates Streets Railroad company.\n\n\n\nUpon his death in 1905, Dropsie, a life-long bachelor, bequeathed his entire estate to the establishment of a College _��for the promotion of and instruction in the Hebrew and Cognate languages and their respective literatures. _�� He further directed that _��there shall be no discrimination on account of creed, color or sex, _�� in the criteria of admission to the College. So was born [Dropsie College, ] this pioneering experiment in Jewish higher education planted in the soil of American democratic principles_�� (Arthur Kiron). Dropsie was a protege of Isaac Leeser and wrote Panegyric on the Life of the Rev. Isaac Leeser.

He earned the rank of major with a citation for bravery. \n\n\n\nAfter the war, Nones returned to Philadelphia a war hero, but struggled to make a living. As a notary public and government interpreter, he barely earned enough to feed his growing family, which eventually numbered 14 children. Nonetheless, he was active in civic and Jewish communal affairs. Nones served as an officer of the Society of Ezrath Orchim, the first organized Jewish charity in Philadelphia and as president of that city's Congregation Mikveh Israel. He was also an active member of an anti-slavery society. \n\n\n\nTaken from an Article by Michael Feldberg (AJHS)��_��_ In the early Republic, the first two political parties, Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans routinely and falsely charged one another with corruption, sexual scandal and even treason. In Philadelphia in 1800, the Federalists introduced anti-Semitism into the political fray.

This historically important letter was written during the period where American artists, for the most part, were vastly over shadowed by their European brethren.\n\n\n\nAngelo Heilprin was born on March 31, 1853 (-1907) at S��toralja�_jhely, Hungary to Michael Heilprin, a scholar of Polish origin. Angelo was the first Jew in America to play a major role in the field of paleontology and geology. Given his pioneering work and role as a curator, may well be the most renowned American Jew in that field.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was an American naturalist, geologist, and traveler. Taken by his father to the United States in 1856. Some years later he returned to Europe, where he was educated. From 1876 to 1878 he continued his studies at the Royal School of Mines, London with Huxley as his guide; at the Imperial Geological Institution of Vienna, and at Florence and Geneva, subsequently returning to the U.S. He was professor of invertebrate paleontology and of geology at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (1880-1900); curator in charge of the museum of that institution (1883-1892)��_ founded in 1812, The Academy of Natural Sciences is the oldest continually operating museum of its kind in the Western Hemisphere; professor of geology at the Wagner Free Institute of Science in Philadelphia (1885-1890); and in 1891 was the first president of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia, serving for seven years. He did great geographic exploration work in Mexico and elsewhere. The society gives out a Heilprin medal which it has presented to distinguished authors like Thor Heyerdahl, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, John Glenn and others. Heilprin also demonstrated his ability as an artist and in 1880 exhibited autumn's First Whisper at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and Forest Exiles at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1883. Heilprin was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1897. He edited, along with his brother Louis Heilprin, Lippincott's New Gazetteer (1905).\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1F01D5BC-4F74-4851-AC48-ADA859E272EC}","objects_refno":"2012.03.04.00001","objects_customfield_6":"THE JEWISH ENCYLOPEDIA","objects_customfield_5":"Heilprin, Angelo","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"3/23/1884","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Letter on the stationary of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, written by Angelo Heilprin (Curator in charge of the museum of that institution) to C.

As a Trustee and benefactor of Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he is inquiring into the suitability of Isaac Leeser who is being considered for the position as Hazan. It is a glowing letter of recommendation that helps Leeser obtain his 1st important pulpit.\n\n\n\nThis letter is the most historically important religious document in the Collection\n\n\n\nBackground ...Jacob Mordecai (1762, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - 1838, Richmond Virginia)\n\n\n\nHe was a pioneer in education, in Colonial America, having established the Warrenton NC Female Seminary, also known as Mordecai's Female Academy.\n\n\n\nThe son of Moses and Esther Mordecai, observant Jews who in 1760 emigrated from Germany to Philadelphia. He attended private schools, receiving a classical education. At age 13, Mordecai served as a rifleman when the Continental Congress was resident in Philadelphia and later helped supply the Continental Army as a clerk to David Franks, the Jewish quartermaster to General George Washington. After the war, Mordecai moved to New York and married Judith Myers. In 1792, Judith and Jacob moved to Warrenton, North Carolina, a small town well situated on the roads linking Richmond, Charleston and Savannah.\n\n\n\nMordecai first made his mark as a tobacco merchant in Warrenton. He was not, however, particularly interested in his business pursuits. He managed to obtain an excellent knowledge of Hebrew language and literature and studiously devoted himself to literary pursuits, especially biblical research, and wrote many scholarly articles.\n\n\n\nReversal of fortune made it necessary for him to give up his business, leaving him with the dilemma of how to support his large family. In the summer of 1808, some of the locals met with Jacob and offered to help support the establishment of an academy for girls, on the condition that he would become its headmaster. The influential town leaders regarded him highly for his learning and wisdom and were sure that he had the skills and temperament to be an effective teacher. In 1809, the school opened with 30 students and quickly became a family project. In the beginning, Jacob and Rebecca taught all the classes. Soon they were joined in the classroom by their daughter Rachael and in later years by two of their sons. The younger Mordecai children helped with the cooking and care of the dormitories. The only instructor in the academy who was not a member of the family was the music teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school's curriculum was not limited to academics; it also stressed proper manners and demeanor. Students were subject to considerable personal discipline and a highly structured day. High standards of behavior and performance were the norm for both students and faculty. The goal was to properly mold both the character and intellectual development of the students. The girls were required to wash their own utensils and maintain a high level of personal hygiene. Since the overwhelming majority of girls who attended the academy came from well-to-do homes in which they were pampered, some of them must have had trouble adjusting to the school's regimen.\n\n\n\nMordecai made sure that students attended the church of their choice. He was careful to avoid all doctrinal and sectarian discussions in school activities. At the same time he provided opportunities for all of his students to discuss philosophical and ethical issues.\n\n\n\nIn 1819, at age 56, ten years after opening his Female Academy, Jacob Mordecai chose to sell the highly successful enterprise and move his family to Richmond, Virginia. He purchased a farm and lived as an active member of Richmond's Jewish community, serving as president of its Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{36C33F79-61B6-4465-8BB0-A1616D6DE7FF}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03611","objects_customfield_6":"NUMEROUS","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / MORDECAI, JACOB / DE CORDOVA, RAPHAEL","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"6/10/1829","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Jacob Mordecai of Richmond, Virginia, responding to a request by Raphael De Cordova, a trustee and benefactor of Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia.

His small and untidy writing often a bit difficult to discern (some Hebrew words interspersed throughout). Basically discusses Hebrew subjects about which he and Leeser mutually interested and evidently writing about for articles for the Occident. He mentions a subject which he discussed in an earlier letter (see No. 765 in HCA catalog for Sept. 21, 2006): I have noted your advice in regards to the lady we question. I don't know her, except when I meet her with her friends but if I understand her character truly, and these days of homeopathy, when similar (?)at that point he continues discussing the lady, but very difficult to make out his writing and few Hebrew words interspersed, but it does have the makings of something interesting! Cohen concludes asking if Leeser will be coming to Baltimore as holidays are approaching. Invites him to see the new synagogue to be consecrated, hopes he will be able to attend. Back sheet acts as cover with address to Leeser\n\n\n\nThe Cohen family of Baltimore, originally from Bavaria, has occupied an important place in the Jewish community and in municipal life since the early years of the nineteenth century. Its first representative in America was Jacob I. Cohen, who came from Oberdorf, near N�_rdlingen, Bavaria, in 1773, and settled in Lancaster, Pa. Thence he removed to Charleston, S. C., and, after serving in the Revolutionary war, to Richmond, Va. Here he was joined, in 1787, by his brother, Israel I. Cohen, whose wife and seven children-the oldest son being eighteen years of age-went to Baltimore in 1808. The children were Jacob I. Cohen, Jr., Philip I. Cohen, Mendes I. Cohen, Benjamin I. Cohen, David I. Cohen, Joshua I. Cohen (1801-70), and Miriam. \n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua I. Cohen (1801-70), was a physician, and one of the earliest aurists-perhaps the first-in the United States. He occupied the position of professor of geology and mineralogy in the academic department of the University of Maryland, was president (1857-58) of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. Together with a friend, he established an eye and ear institute in Baltimore. He has left one publication, Post-Mortem Appearances in a Case of Deafness. He had an outstanding library and Cyrus Adler compiled its catalogue in 1877.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{8C5C46CD-50AD-4CCF-8DE2-F88D99EC925E}","objects_refno":"2008.03.01.00014","objects_customfield_6":"THE JEWISH ENCYLOPEDIA","objects_customfield_5":"Leeser, \n\nIsaac / Cohen, Joshua I.","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"9/10/1848","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Two page letter from Joshua I.

Henry Cohen married Mathilda Samuel (of the prominent Samuel family of Liverpool) in 1844. The Cohen family maintained close relations with important London Jewish families, including the Aguilars. Both he and Mathilda were leaders in the Philadelphia Jewish community. In a biographical sketch she is described as a Lady of culture; brilliant conversationalist....executive ability and a dignified presence; friendship of a select civic circle; obtained distinction beyond the Jewish Community during the Civil War she was the Delegate to the women's Branch of the Sanitary Commission and a member of their famous Fair. As part of her various civic projects, Mathilda Cohen founded the Committee of Thirteen, which organized the art exhibit at Philadelphia's 1876 centennial celebration. She exerted great efforts on behalf of numerous Jewish Charities.\n\n\n\n Charles and Mary had one younger sister named Katherine who also attained prominence, as an artist and sculptress. She studied art in Philadelphia, New York, Paris and Italy, and was renowned for her many artistic productions, including the busts of several famous individuals, such as Judge Mayer Sulzberger and Lucien Moss.\n\n\n\nCharles Joseph Cohen was born on September 21, 1847 in Philadelphia into a prosperous family and died in Atlantic City, New Jersey, September 17, 1927. He was a prominent member of a number of Philadelphia Jewish and other civic and charitable organizations. Rebecca Gratz, the famous Philadelphia Jewish leader, was Charles' godmother.\n\n\n\nMary M. Cohen was born in Philadelphia February 26, 1854 and died in Atlantic City, New Jersey on July 2, 1911. She was a leading exponent of Jewish and women's causes, a journalist, writer, and poet. She was active in numerous civic organizations, and was among the founders of the National Council of Jewish Women and the founder and life-time honorary President of the Browning Society.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2DAF3A40-39B1-4C94-8B16-D56B0F199C63}","objects_refno":"2012.02.19.00004","objects_customfield_6":"History of Jews in Philadelphia by MAX WHITEMAN","objects_customfield_5":"R.P. / Cohen, Mathilda (Mrs. Henry Cohen)","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"7/24/1848","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Letter to Mathilda Samuel Cohen from R.P., discussing family","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"Cohen, Mathilda","corporatio":"","merger":"Cohen, Mathilda | R.

In this paragraph he clearly states his objections to the micro management of the Board of Managers and their contract... I had actually resigned my office into the hands of the then President, a step which, had I been left to my own conviction, I would have persevered in and retired ten years ago to private life, as I finally did at the end of last September.

He is asking for a member (congregation) that Leeser send copies of past Occidents that he requested. He also mentions a Mr. B. Abeles and a Mr. Grunsfelder as persons to see for funds that are owed. Rabbi Bernard Illowy came to America in 1852 as the first Orthodox Rabbi in America to have earned a PhD, became a renowned Orthodox scholar and speaker in the US. It would be clear that eventually Leeser viewed him as an intellectual threat. He had a major falling out with Isaac Leeser over the Cleveland Conference in 1855 and Leeser attacked him in the Occident. This letter is probably circa 1853 when he was a Rabbi in Philadelphia; also Mr. B. Abeles pops up as active in the Philadelphia Jewish Communi9ty.\n\n\n\nHe first had an occasional teaching and preaching job in the Largest Ashkenazim synagogue in NYC Anshei  Chesed. He then accepted a teaching position in the newly formed Hebrew School of Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia. One year later he was named Rabbi. He left in 1854 for St. Louis, then in 1856 for Syracuse and in 1857 left for the Lloyd Street Synagogue in Baltimore. In 1861 he left to become the Rabbi of Shaarei Chesed in New Orleans until his retirement in 1869.\n\n\n\nDr. Illowy was known as an eminent Talmudist and thorough scholar. He was a strict adherent, in principles and practice, of Orthodox Judaism and from this he never swerved. He preached it in the pulpit, taught it to the children in the congregational schools which he always established wherever he officiated, and championed it in a fierce polemical warfare, extending over many years, with the leaders of the Reform movement in this country, principally Doctors Wise and Lilienthal. He had the distinction of being in his day in this country, the only rabbi with a thorough Talmudic education and a university training to stand for the cause of Orthodoxy.\n\n\n\nHis polemical letters were published in various Jewish periodicals of this country (The Asmonean, the Israelite, the Jewish Messenger, the Occident) and of Europe.\n\n\n\nHe was a powerful and fascinating speaker and convincing preacher, and his ministrations were so successful that his synagogue on Sabbath and holidays was always crowded with worshipers, and many who had strayed away from the fold were brought back again. Many valuable gifts received by him attested the esteem in which he was held by his congregants.

Maimonides was founded 10/28/1867. This is the first edition in this historical marker of the founding of the first rabbinical seminary in America.\n\n\n\nRev. Sabato Morais....In 1845 he went to London to apply for the vacant post of assistant Hazan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city. (The position of Hazzan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.\n\n\n\nIn 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia, became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. Morais became a major force in shaping American Judaism. He was a founder of Conservative Judaism in the America.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{55C39DFB-D478-4819-9234-09E8AC966C28}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03538","objects_customfield_6":"THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OF PHILADELPHIA BY WHITEMAN.","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / MORAIS, SABATO","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"2/5/1868","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"In this two page letter, W.

The letter is written in his small hand and fills all four of the 8 x 10 sheets. The letter is missing the signature page which probably had content.\n\n\n\n As a post script, due to the Congregational debates, in the summer of 1837 Rev. Jacque Lyons of Surinam was asked to come and stand as a candidate. On September 24, 1837 Leeser was elected but with no increase in salary. A relieved Leeser wrote the Lyon is subdued. As a general context this was all happening during the Financial Panic of 1837.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{85029AC9-BACC-41DB-9A10-8D5E93D0F2CD}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03553","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03553","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / REHINE, ZALMA","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"3/5/1837","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to his uncle, Zalma Rehine, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Forst and myself. Being much engaged I shall not have time to call again.  Therefore trust that this will be sufficient_�_and request you give permission to Mr. Leeser when you see him. This is Clara Forst, the daughter of Abraham Forst the M-I Shochet who died in 1830]. This was a mixed marriage. Malcolm Stern lists Clara Forst & Philip Mann as being married in 1834. The question is did the marriage take place by Rabbi Leeser as requested. It would seem highly unlikely.\n\n \n\n\nThis is one of the earliest requests to have to have Leeser perform a marriage. As time moved on this concept of requiring approval on various religious duties became a major area of disagreement between Leeser and the lay powers of Mikvah Israel. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{B55E07E6-4242-4F40-BBEA-22CFD0BE148C}","objects_refno":"2007.04.18.00001","objects_customfield_6":"First American Jewish Families by Stern","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / Mann, Phillip / Phillips, Levi / Forst, Clara","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"1/1/1834","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Phillip Mann to \"L.

Many a white hair..I am pale and thinner than when you last saw me. \n\n \n\nWhile Sara Gratz Moses Josephs marriage date is listed in Malcolm Stern's genealogies it does not list her death date.\n\n\n\nPhoebe Hays Valentine (who resides in Canada) is a generation older than Sara Gratz Moses and was possibly the match maker in this marriage. Sara will be 31 at the time of the marriage, an advanced age to never have been married.\n\n\n\nSara's mother died in 1823 & was raised by her aunt Rebecca Gratz.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{01B02730-9708-44E0-B2FA-6BE624C32AF2}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03573","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03573","objects_customfield_5":"MOSES, SARA GRATZ (12/1817. ?) / VALENTINE, PHOEBE HAYS","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"4/8/1848","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A detailed and highly personal, four page letter from Sara Gratz Moses in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Phoebe Hays Valentine in Montreal, Canada.

This item is a billhead re: billing for this trip.\n\n\n\nMayer Sulzberger was an American judge and Jewish communal leader; born at Heidelsheim, Bruchsal, Baden, June 22, 1843. He went to Philadelphia with his parents in 1848, and was educated at the Central High School of Philadelphia, and after graduating he studied law in the office of Moses A. Dropsie. In 1864 he was admitted to the bar, and attained eminence in the practice of his profession. He was elected judge of the Court of Common Pleas on the Republican ticket in 1895, and was reelected as a nominee of both parties in 1904, becoming the presiding judge of the Court of Common Pleas No. 2.\n\n \n\nSulzberger throughout his career showed great interest in Jewish affairs. While studying for the bar he taught at the Hebrew Education Society's school. For a time he was interested in the affairs of Maimonides College and was secretary of its board. He was closely associated with Isaac Leeser, and assisted that scholar in editing The Occident, contributing to it a partial translation of Maimonides' Morch Nebukim. After Leeser's death Sulzberger edited vol. xxvi. of The Occident. He was one of the founders of the Young Men's Hebrew Association, which he served as president; and he has taken great interest in the Jewish Hospital of Philadelphia, of which he has been vice-president since 1880. He was from the beginning (in 1888) chairman of the publication committee of the Jewish Publication Society of America; was one of the original trustees of the Baron de Hirsch fund; and interested himself in the establishment of agricultural colonies at Woodbine, N. J., and in Connecticut.\n\n \n\nSulzberger had one of the best private libraries in America; it contained a very large number of Hebraica and Judaica, together with many other early Hebrew printed books (including no less than forty-five Incunabula), and many manuscripts, and these he presented to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, at whose reorganization he assisted and of which he is a life director. Sulzberger was a finished orator, and was chosen as the orator of the Jewish community upon several notable occasions. The honorary degree of doctor of laws was conferred upon him by the Jefferson Medical College, of which later became trustee.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{FF307C2C-604A-46E1-B07D-136E006B1286}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03667","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03667","objects_customfield_5":"SULZBERGER, MAYER JUDGE","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"9/1/1880","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Sulzberger's trip to Europe","person_nam":"Sulzberger, Mayer","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Sulzberger, Mayer","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1880-09-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHI 276","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_276_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_276_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_276_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_276_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2028,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref3023","ref_2":"cid4639031","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"ITEMS 20.679 THRU 20.683 RELATE TO HIS EUOPEAN TRIP RE: BOARD OF DELEGATES OF AMERICAN; ISRAELITES AND ISSUES OF EUROPEAN JEWERY; ; ASD LETTER  BY 26 PHILADELPHIA JEWS...RE: INVITATION TO DINNER PRIOR TO EUROPEAN TRIP;","thing_uuid":"{04F1FA34-3796-4CA7-8DD1-E2E444CC1C03}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03588","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03588","objects_customfield_5":"SULZBERGER, MAYER JUDGE / 26 PHILADELPHIA JEWS","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"5/24/1880","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Sulzberger's trip to Europe","person_nam":"Sulzberger, Mayer","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Sulzberger, Mayer","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1880-05-24T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHIL 274","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_274_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_274_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_274_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_274_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2032,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref3047","ref_2":"cid4639007","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"Tobias, T.

Simon was also a coal and railroad pioneer.  They were among the founders of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  The Gratz business was located in the Jacob Graff House at 7th and Market, the very house in which Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.  (This letter was written 25 days after Jefferson's death.)\n\n\n\nSAMUEL HAYS ( 1764- 1839) was married to Richea Gratz and the brother-in-law as well as business associate of Simon Gratz.

Biddle graduated from Princeton at age 15 and later served as secretary to James Monroe.  At the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson, he became the first editor of the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Biddle has been called the prototype of the modern business executive (Fritz Redlich, The Molding of American Banking: Men and Ideas, 1947).\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CE09793A-FC63-4788-B855-409AB096E751}","objects_refno":"2010.09.29.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.09.29.00001","objects_customfield_5":"GRATZ, SIMON / Hays, Samuel / BIDDLE, NICHOLAS","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"7/29/1826","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Signed letter from Nicholas Biddle to Thomas Wilson, a bank cashier recently transferred from Philadelphia to New Orleans, concerning Simon Gratz and his brothers and Samuel Hays","person_nam":"Wilson, Thomas","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Wilson, Thomas","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1826-07-29T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Gratz Family","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"73","tiff_locat":"doc_gf_73_1r.tif; doc_gf_73_1v.tif; doc_gf_73_2r.tif; doc_gf_73_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2034,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref3098","ref_2":"cid4638959","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Miscellaneous","descriptio":"Aaron, David.

The association was incorporated September 23, 1865. The first site of the hospital was at Fifty-Sixth Street and Haverford road.

In Philadelphia in 1800, the Federalists introduced anti-Semitism into the political fray. A vivid example is the vicious attack launched against Benjamin Nones.  \n\n\n\nBorn in France in 1757, Nones immigrated to Philadelphia around 1772. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Nones chose to fight for his adopted nation. In 1777, Nones saw heavy action as part of General Pulaski's legion. He earned the rank of major with a citation for bravery. \n\n\n\nAfter the war, Nones returned to Philadelphia a war hero, but struggled to make a living. As a notary public and government interpreter, he barely earned enough to feed his growing family, which eventually numbered 14 children. Nonetheless, he was active in civic and Jewish communal affairs. Nones served as an officer of the Society of Ezrath Orchim, the first organized Jewish charity in Philadelphia and as president of that city's Congregation Mikveh Israel. He was also an active member of an anti-slavery society. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{C80E28E0-4C52-4856-B0D2-03665C86A7F6}","objects_refno":"2011.01.07.00001","objects_customfield_6":"HISTORY JEWS OF PHILA.(TO 1840) BY M.

As a member of the harrowing American arctic expedition under the command of Dr. Elisha Kent Kane in search of the lost British explorer Sir John Franklin, Hayes became obsessed with making his own mark in the far northern polar regions. He organized his own privately funded voyage to the Arctic in 1860, during which he claimed to have reached a farthest north and to have stood on the edge of the fabled Open Polar Sea, a mythical ice-free zone in the high northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nThrough his own hard fought experiences, combined with the knowledge learned from native Greenlanders or Polar Eskimos, he successfully influenced the course of Arctic discovery, causing perceptive explorers to follow his guidance and lead. Directing the same ambition to humanitarian and social causes, during the devastating U.S. Civil War and as an elected politician in New York State during its Gilded Age, Hayes served the public good for a decade, with accomplishments as far reaching as his Arctic service, but little recognized even during his lifetime. In this book, which draws upon Hayes family papers, the little viewed diaries from Hayes s own expeditions, as well as other unpublished primary sources, the story emerges of a remarkable but forgotten explorer, writer, politician, and humanitarian who epitomized the rugged and restless spirit of adventure and individualism of 19th-century America.

Col.Isaac Franks   Officer in the American Revolutionary army; born in New York May 27, 1759; died in Philadelphia March 4, 1822. At the outbreak of the war in June, 1776, when only seventeen years old he enlisted in Colonel Lesher's regiment, New York Volunteers, and served with it in the battle of Long Island; on Sept. 15 of the same year he was taken prisoner at the capture of New York, but effected his escape after three months' detention. In 1777 he was appointed to the quartermaster's department, and in Jan., 1778, he was made forage-master, being stationed at West Point until Feb. 22, 1781, when he was appointed by Congress ensign in the Seventh Massachusetts Regiment; he continued in that capacity until July, 1782, when he resigned on account of ill health. \n\n\n\nIn 1789 Franks was appointed a notary public of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; in 1794 Governor Mifflin commissioned him lieutenant colonel of the Second Regiment, Philadelphia county. It was in his house at Germantown, a suburb of Philadelphia, that President Washington resided during the prevalence of yellow fever in the city in 1793. He was appointed in 1795 a justice of the peace for the townships of Germantown and Roxborough. On Feb. 18, 1819, he was made prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and help that position until his death three years later. Colonel Franks' portrait was painted by Gilbert Stewart, and is now in the Gibson Collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nHistory of Whiskey Rebellion    In 1791, as part of Alexander Hamilton's economic program, the Federal government issued a tax on distillers of whiskey. After several years of tension and hardships faced by farmers on Pennsylvania's western frontier (for whom whiskey was a principal source of income), violence began spreading against the region's tax collectors. After negotiations with the insurrectionists failed, Washington declared martial law in the region on 7 August 1794. A military force, composed of various state militias and under the direct command of Washington, Hamilton and Lighthorse Harry Lee, assembled and marched into western Pennsylvania. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{F85CD7D6-9B2A-41C6-BFC4-4452B6EF66CF}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03330","objects_customfield_6":"AMER.

He organized his own privately funded voyage to the Arctic in 1860, during which he claimed to have reached a farthest north and to have stood on the edge of the fabled Open Polar Sea, a mythical ice-free zone in the high northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nThrough his own hard fought experiences, combined with the knowledge learned from native Greenlanders or Polar Eskimos, he successfully influenced the course of Arctic discovery, causing perceptive explorers to follow his guidance and lead. Directing the same ambition to humanitarian and social causes, during the devastating U.S. Civil War and as an elected politician in New York State during its Gilded Age, Hayes served the public good for a decade, with accomplishments as far reaching as his Arctic service, but little recognized even during his lifetime. In this book, which draws upon Hayes family papers, the little viewed diaries from Hayes s own expeditions, as well as other unpublished primary sources, the story emerges of a remarkable but forgotten explorer, writer, politician, and humanitarian who epitomized the rugged and restless spirit of adventure and individualism of 19th-century America.

In 1852  there were 30 Jewish families in Pittsburgh, and six years later the number doubled.  By 1854 a group meeting in a room over Vigilant Fire Department organized itself as Rodef Shalom, and in 1861 a building was dedicated on Hancock Street (later Eighth Street) where a Mr. Armhold served as reader, mohel, and shohet.  German was the language of sermons and records, but the congregants showed willingness to modify practice regarding covered heads and mixed seating [male & female together], among others.  This caused dissension, and a new group was created in 1864 calling itself Etz Hayim, more conservative in practice.  In 1861 Rodef Shalom brought a young English Jew, Josiah Cohen, to head its religious school, and preach in English.  He later became a distinguished judge. \n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{A6AF1FE8-31FC-4B1C-B10D-26C3BA459425}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03442","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03442","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / GALLINGER, N.","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"1/18/1850","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Early letter from N.

Addressed to Callender Irvine from Captain Woolley. As above, confirming and detailing Woolley's purchase from Philipson.\n\n\n\nThe Philipson brothers of Philadelphia were partners and merchants in fur and lead. They transacted business with John Jacob Astor and Merriwether Lewis. \n\n \n\nAs the west opened up, and opportunities beckoned, the Philipsons looked to Missouri. By 1807, the Philipsons had established a strong mercantile presence in St. Louis.  The Philipsons are recognized as being the first identifiable Jews to settle in St. Louis.  \n\n\n\nOf the three brothers, Simon has been described as a charming eccentric who collected curios, paintings, and oddities. Current scholarship suggests that Simon's role in the partnership is thinly documented. These three items, in some part, yield an interesting clue to the Philipsons' activities in Pittsburg during the War of 1812.\n\n\n\nOf interest, during the year in which this pig lead was purchased from Philipson, Captain Woolley was assisting Oliver Hazard Perry with ordnance supplies for Perry's Lake Erie campaign.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{E302F8C9-7C61-4B64-ACDE-54A5A0E932E7}","objects_refno":"2008.12.13.00001","objects_customfield_6":"Zion in the Valley: The Jewish Community of St. Louis‰Û_ (1997) by Ehrlich / Wolf, The history of the Jews of Philadelphia","objects_customfield_5":"Philipson, Simon","objects_objtype":"LETTER (2) /  Receipts (1)","objects_date":"9/15/1813","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"One receipt signed by Simon Philipson, acknowldeging receiving bills of exchange for an enormous sale of pig lead to Captain Abraham R.

When he immigrates to American he is a frequent contributor to the Occident and acceptance of proselytes is again a subject matter. Unfortunately the Collection houses only a fragment on subsequent American letter (11/2/1855). Of interest here are two points (1) Leeser thought enough of Dr. Aaron Gunzburg_�_s scholarship to translate the letter (was it published?) and (2) The only example in the Collection of a correspondent from Europe who latter immigrated (did Leeser help place him?).  It was found with other Leeser papers.This document has been reviewed and verified at the Katz Center of the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Arthur Kiron, the Schottenstein-Jesselson Curator of Judaica Collections and Bruce Nielsen, Judaica Public Services Librarian and Archivist, who is a trained paleographer,\n\n\n\nRev.

(The position of Hassan, literally cantor, in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of rabbi). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English.

Store in Baltimore:\n\n\n\nHutzler Brothers Company, one of Baltimore's major retail stores, was founded in 1858 by Abram G. Hutzler, son of German-Jewish immigrants when he took over a small shop operated by his brother-in-law, Elkan Bamberger. Because he was too young to secure credit in his own name, Abram Hutzler opened the store under his father's name, M[oses] Hutzler &amp; Son, however Moses was never connected with the business.

As the central civilian in the government, Morris was, next to General George Washington, the most powerful man in America.. His successful administration led to the sobriquet, Financier of the Revolution. At the same time he was Agent of Marine, a position he took without pay, and from which he controlled the Continental Navy. He was one of Pennsylvania's original pair of US senators, serving from 1789 to 1795.

Crosman, Asst. Q-Master..Corpis Christy...2/7/1846\n\n\n\nAbraham Charles Myers, the Confederate Quartermaster General, was born in Georgetown, SC, in 1811. His grandfather had been Charleston's first rabbi. Entering West Point in 1828, Myers took five years to graduate because of poor grades. He graduated 32nd in the class of 1833. While serving in the Seminole Wars, Myers was appointed to the Quartermaster's Department, where he served until surrendering the supply depot at New Orleans to Louisiana in 1861.\n\n\n\nFort Myers was built along the Caloosahatchee River as one of the first bases of operations during the Seminole Indian Wars. Fort Myers was named in honor of Colonel Abraham C. Myers, the son-in-law of the commander of Fort Brooke in Tampa (David Twiggs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He was made Confederate Quartermaster General in December 1861. Myers set up an elaborate supply network for the Confederacy, but lack of planning and inefficient subordinates led to problems. Myers also fought with the Ordnance Department over hides from slaughtered animals: his department was responsible for shoes and harness, Ordnance for artillery harness and cartridge boxes. When he was nominated for brigadier general by the Confederate Congress, Davis instead removed Myers from the office and replaced him with Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton. Part of this had to do with a situation outside Myers' control. His wife, the beautiful daughter of Maj. Gen. David Twiggs, Marian Twiggs Myers, had recently commented that Varina Davis, wife of the President, looked like a squaw. Myers refused to serve under Lawton and moved to Georgia and was a tobacco merchant. He died in 1889 in Washington, D.C.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1CAB7FC6-BCBE-475B-8A4C-A1E985230562}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03320","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03320","objects_customfield_5":"MYERS, ABRAHAM","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"2/7/1846","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"Confederate military letter by Abraham Charles Myers, Capt. at San Antonio, Texas to Capt.

Schoenfeld & Brother in Red Bluff, California\n\n\n\nSalomen D. Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.  He has held the office of Scribe and holds now the office of King.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{C9DF45CD-B107-4C33-956F-F7017D767DB7}","objects_refno":"2008.01.01.00008","objects_customfield_6":"Memorial & Biographical History of Northern California, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1891 pg. 550-551","objects_customfield_5":"Dinkelspiel, S.B. / Dinkelspiel, M./  Haber, J. /  Schoenfeld, Salomen D.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"8/6/1877","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Bill made out to Salomen D.

Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.  He has held the office of Scribe and holds now the office of King.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{5B999BCF-1A48-4EA3-8B1E-4E035D2CFB92}","objects_refno":"2008.01.01.00005","objects_customfield_6":"Memorial & Biographical History of Northern California, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1891 pg. 550-551","objects_customfield_5":"Lobe, Anatole / Schoenfeld, Salomen D.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"6/29/1877","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Billhead from Anatole Lobe made out to Salomen D.

Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.  He has held the office of Scribe and holds now the office of King.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{F273AA5D-593E-4226-BBC5-375534B83AB2}","objects_refno":"2008.01.01.00004","objects_customfield_6":"Memorial & Biographical History of Northern California, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1891 pg. 550-551","objects_customfield_5":"Schoenfeld, Jonas / Schoenfeld, Salomen D.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"4/13/1878","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Billhead from Jonas Schoenfeld made out to his brother, Salomen D.

Schoenfeld & Brother in Red Bluff, California\n\n\n\nSalomen D. Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.  He has held the office of Scribe and holds now the office of King.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{480FCDE6-EF7C-440F-B313-2F752B7D213E}","objects_refno":"2008.01.01.00007","objects_customfield_6":"Memorial & Biographical History of Northern California, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1891 pg. 550-551","objects_customfield_5":"Hubash, Joseph / Elleau, H./ Kurtz, G.M./  Schoenfeld, Salomen D.","objects_objtype":"BILL HEAD","objects_date":"6/18/1877","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Bill made out to Salomen D.

He finds them praise worthy.The sermon spent significant time on the  on the concept of women's rights in the Jewish religion. It all reads Reform oriented. \n\nThe letter also discusses  the debates; going  on in the congregation, as an historical note iIn 1864, a group broke away from Emanu-El in protest of changes to the prayer book, to form the more Orthodox congregation Ohabai Shalome (Lovers of Peace), additionally he includes newly elected officers with H. Seligman as President. He notes the rapid growth of Israelites throughout California and lists the locations.\n\n\n\nThe letter is important for the details of the sermons and their form given in this important early California synagogue. While this important congregation exists today there are virtually no early records as they were destroyed in the San Francisco fire. In that context this letter is unique. Additionally the Rabbi's whose inaugural sermons are described went on to serve the congregation for 39 years and moved it toward the Reform realm and is credited with the strength of the Temple.\n\n\n\nAs an important post script, Englander writes.... I knew Dr. Wise? I mean Isaac Wise when he was a school teacher in Tachanin Bohemia, then he did not dream of being a Dr. Divinity in America an writing a Jewish History on to become a traveler for the cause of the destruction of our ancient faith.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThe first Jewish services were held in San Francisco in 1849, and major holidays were celebrated in various locations. In 1851, two congregations were formed: Congregation Emanu-El for German Jews and Sherith Israel for Polish Jews.\n\n\n\n Emanu-El, originally Orthodox in orientation, was drawn towards the emerging Reform Movement, guided in part by a series of rabbis with impressive Reform credentials. Over the years Emanu-El became a Reform temple containing many of San Francisco's Jewish elite, listing many of the top mercantile, banking, and political families on its membership rolls.\n\n\n\nEmanu-El's first building in San Francisco was built on Broadway between Powell and Mason Streets in 1854, at the same time the congregation acquired its first full-time ordained Rabbi, Julius Eckman, who served in his post one year. Emanu-El did not regain a full-time rabbi until 1860, when Rabbi Elkan Cohn was hired. Cohn was the congregation's longest serving rabbi, staying until his death in 1889. He reorganized the congregation, revitalized the religious school (first organized in 1858), and inaugurated the confirmation program, which graduated its first class on Shavuot 1862. In 1864, a group broke away from Emanu-El in protest of changes to the prayerbook, to form the more Orthodox congregation Ohabai Shalome (Lovers of Peace).\n\n\n\nBy 1864 the congregation had expanded significantly, and the Sutter Street temple was built and became a local landmark. Destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the temple was rebuilt on the same site and rededicated in 1907. (Unfortunately, most of its papers and records from the time of its founding up until the earthquake were lost in the fire.) \n\n","thing_uuid":"{77E486EB-12C3-4C42-AAFB-EDCF5C710EE5}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03467","objects_customfield_6":"THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OF PHILADELPHIA BY WHITEMAN.","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / ENGLANDER, A.N.","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"10/20/1860","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from A.

It is replete with detail of the development of San Francisco's embryonic community. Little of those early days have survived due to fire & earth quake. Abraham Labatt is a well known California pioneer figure and a founder of the organized Jewish Community in San Francisco, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Labatt writes how well the congregation is doing and they need a Rabbi. He asks Leeser to help...noting San Francisco has 200 families and 50% belong... about 50 children will attend school... attendance at services is never less than 30%. They raised $20,000 the first night for a building and expect it to be finished debt free. The new rabbi should not be old but not 35 as that is too young! He should be an English scholar but conversant with German. He importantly notes that the people are liberal\n\n\n\nTwo of the earliest congregations in California are Emanu-El and Shearit Israel of San Francisco. Both were founded in 1851. The two synagogues were founded simultaneously because the city's Jews could not agree on whether to follow the prayer customs of the Polish or German Jews. Emanu-El was therefore, founded as the congregation of the German Jews and Shearit Israel as the congregation of the Polish Jews. Labatt was active in both, laying Shearit Israel's foundation-stone in 1856 and later serving as president of Congregation Emanuel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Cohen Labatt (1802, Charleston, South Carolina - August 16, 1899, Galveston, Texas) was a prominent pioneer of Reform Judaism in the United States in the 19th century, founding several early congregations. A Sephardic Jew, he was one of the organizers of the Reform congregation in Charleston in 1825. A few years later he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1831 he moved to New Orleans, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits and was one of the founders of the first Jewish congregations in Louisiana. He visited Velasco, Texas in that year and again in 1837 as supercargo of the steamship Columbia, the first merchantman to trade between the U.S., via Charleston, Texas, and Mexico. Labatt went to California in a merchant capacity following the gold rush of 1849, and was one of the founders of the San Francisco synagogue Shearit Israel, laying its foundation-stone in 1856. He would also serve as president of Congregation Emanuel. In 1849 he obtained a dispensation for the David Crockett Masonic lodge, the first regularly instituted lodge in the state of California. He served also as an alderman of San Francisco. Labatt married Caroline Hyams (born 1821) and had sixteen children with her. In the 1860s, they moved to Louisiana, followed by Waco, Texas in 1869, finally settling in Galveston in 1878, where he joined the Jewish Texan Congregation B'nai Israel. He would remain in Galveston for the rest of his life.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{42BA67E4-7092-4E1A-A221-274931A09DB2}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03545","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03545","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / LABATT, Abraham Cohen","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"3/16/1854","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Abraham Cohen Labatt, a prominent pioneer of Reform Judaism, in San Francisco to Isaac Leeser.

(Maurice Kahn was a San Francisco pioneer in the grain business).  \n\n\n\nJacob Nieto (1863-1930) was first a rabbi in Sheffield, England (1889-1892), and then served as rabbi of San Francisco���s Congregation Sherith Israel, from 1893 to 1930.\n\n\n\nRabbi Jacob Nieto was widely recognized as an impassioned and spellbinding orator and a champion of humanitarian causes and controversial issues, as well as a supporter of the Spanish-American War and manifest destiny. He served as a president of the Anti-Capital Punishment League and as president of the San Francisco branch of the National Industrial Peace Association. With Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of San Francisco���s Congregation Emanu-El, Nieto played a role in the reorganization of the city's Young Men���s Hebrew Association, a precursor to San Francisco's Jewish Community Center.\n\n\n\nNieto also served on the Board of Governors of San Francisco���s Jewish Education Society; as president of the Board of Ministers of Northern California; as president of the Western Association of Jewish Ministers; as president of B���nai B���rith District Grand Lodge No. 4; as the Grand Orator and Chaplain of the Free and Accepted Masons of California; and as one of the original members of the San Francisco Council of the Boy Scouts.\n\n\n\nAfter the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Rabbi Nieto organized disinfection work and was in charge of issuing passes to those who wished to leave San Francisco. He continued to serve as rabbi of Sherith Israel after the earthquake, when the congregation���s synagogue served temporarily as courtroom.\n\n\n\nIn 1916, he advised merchants and labor union members to join against the well-fed paunches from Montgomery Street who were sending them out to die, but he did America���s efforts in World War I after the United States declared war.\n\n\n\nHe wrote and preached forcefully against local attempts at converting Jews and the presentation of the passion play in Freiburg. He also cooperated with Catholic priests to fight the anti-Catholic organization, the American Protective Association. He also supported civil rights for blacks and women's rights and fought against white slavery. He also wrote treatises, plays, and poetry and he contributed to and/or served as the editor of the New Occident; the Jewish Journal; the Jewish Times; and was a feature writer for the San Francisco Bulletin, which carried his column Without Prejudice: a Look at Current Problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of t document was printed and written in Hebrew.  It���s a beautiful document of marriage with a printed blue number 135.  \n\n\n\n The congregation was founded in April of 1851, early in the Gold Rush history of San Francisco.  The document has some tears but no major problems.

Document has some great engravings.\n\n\n\nSloss was born on July 13, 1.823, in Untereisenheim, Ba�_varia; but he spent the greater part of his busy life in California. He was the youngest of five children, two brothers and three sisters. At seventeen he came across the plains to California, and in 1849 he settled in Sacramento. In part�_nership with Simon Greenewald and Lewis Gerstle, he estab�_lished in 1857 the mercantile firm of Louis Sloss and Com�_pany. The flood of 1862 in Sacramento destroyed their store, and Sloss moved to San Francico to 'embark on new business ventures. He became a mining broker and was elected a mem�_ber of the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board in 1866. He resigned in 1873.\n\n\n\n In 1868 the Alaska Commercial Com�_pany was organized and its presidency occupied his time and energy. Louis Sloss is remembered as humble and modest; a foremost San Franciscan and a generous humanitarian. He died at his home in San Rafael on June 4, 1902.  With his passing the community lost one of its outstanding Jews\n\n\n\nHiram Throop Graves was born December 12, 1824 in Batavia, Genessee County, New York. He joined the Cayuga Joint Stock Company, consisting of eighty young men, and sailed from New York on February 28th, 1849 on the barque Samuel Barney. They made an eight day stop in Callao, Peru for additional supplies and water and entered the Golden Gate on October 12th, 1849. Once in San Francisco his company sold all their merchandise. Graves mentions that the Van Ness House on Stockton Street (since moved) was built of lumber brought out by his company. \n\n\n\nMr. Graves spent the first winter in San Francisco, and in March 1850 went up to the diggings settlement of Auburn. He mined successfully there for three months with a partner. Next he moved on to the South Fork of the Yuba River and then to Bear River near Illinois town. He left the mines in September and returned to San Francisco. Mr. Graves entered the pioneer Assay office of Moffat & Co., and when merged into the U.S. Mint, became connected with the Coiners Department of that institution, where he remained until 1859, as Assistant Coiner. From 1859 to 1873, Mr. Graves engaged in the manufacture of wire goods. In 1873, he was appointed Secretary of the Masonic and Savings and Loan Bank. He also served as one of the Directors of The Society of California Pioneers as well as Secretary of the Society \n\n","thing_uuid":"{83E16452-6422-4ADE-A9B5-EDE3A8AB26EA}","objects_refno":"2009.08.13.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2009.08.13.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Sloss, Louis","objects_objtype":"MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE","objects_date":"4/28/1885","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Legal","descript_1":"Certificate for the Society of California Pioneers, signed at bottom by Louis Sloss as President, founder of mercantile firm of Louis Sloss and Company with Simon Greenewald and Lewis Gerstle and president of the Alaska Commercial Company, and H.T.( Hira","person_nam":"Sloss, Louis","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Sloss, Louis","location":"San Francisco, CA","date":"1885-04-28T00:00:00Z","container_":"Box","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"3","containe_2":"Object","containe_3":"8","tiff_locat":"bx3_8_1r.tif; bx3_8_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.419419,37.774928]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2578,"longitude":-122.4194193,"latitude":37.77492773,"ref_1":"ref3230","ref_2":"cid4638827","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Miscellaneous","descriptio":"Sutro Baths.

Schoenfeld & signed by  Salomen D. Schoenfeld & Brother\n\n\n\nMade out to  Salomen D. Schoenfeld & Brother in Red Bluff, California\n\n\n\nSalomen D. Schoenfeld is one of the prominent citizens and merchants of Red Bluff, California. He was born in Westphalia, Germany, March 14, 1836.  His parents, David and Hannah Schoenfeld, both Hebrews, were born and died in Germany.  The father was a merchant and a farmer.  Salomen D. attended school in his native place, Doessel and the adjoining city of Warburg.\n\n            He came to the United States to engage in business, landing in New York city, where he had relatives.  At that place he was offered a situation as porter in a store at a salary of $2.50 per week, but not being accustomed to that kind of work he did not accept the offer.  Soon he engaged in business for himself.  After remaining in the State of New York a little over a year, he came to California, in 1856.  During his short sojourn in the East, he had made enough money to pay his passage to San Francisco and had some left with which to make a start in business.  He had a brother in San Francisco, who was conducting a wholesale and retail butchering business, and with him our subject wanted to take a situation.  His brother, however, thought he had better start on his own hook.  Mr. Schoenfeld had a friend who had come from Germany with him and who was at that time engaged in business in Calaveras County.  They met at San Francisco and decided they would go into business together at Red Bluff.  His friend had a chance to sell his business, so they bought a stock of goods and were fitting a store to receive them, when the friend's chance to sell proved a failure.  Another gentleman, before unknown to Mr. Schoenfeld, became his partner, and they entered into business in 1856 in the Kraft building, near the site of this present store on Main street, between Oak and Pine.  They subsequently opened a branch store in Horsetown, Shasta County, and his partner, Mr. J.S. Rosenbaum, had charge of it.  That enterprise was an unsuccessful one and they sold the store.  In 1861 Mr. Schoenfeld bought out his partner and continued the business alone, having one of his brothers as clerk in the store.  Seeing a business opening in Star City, Nevada, he started a branch business there with his brother in charge, the store being conducted under the name of S. D. Schoenfeld & Brother.  This being in a mining place, the business was a profitable one, and they remained there until there was such an excitement over the Idaho mines, when they removed to Silver City, Idaho.  Mr.Schoenfeld shipped his brother's goods via Sacramento, and they continued there until 1868, when they sold out at a loss.\n\n            February 22, 1869, Mr. Schoenfeld with his brother Jonas started for a visit to his mother and other relatives at his old home in Germany.  While absent he purchased goods in New York, Philadelphia, London and Germany, and sent them to Red Bluff.  Upon their arrival in 1870 he did a large business, his trade extending 200 miles from Red Bluff.  In 1873 he made a trip to New York to attend the marriage of his brother Jonas, and while in that city made a large purchase of goods.  After his return he went to San Francisco to attend to some office work for his brother Jacob.  In 1876 he took his brother Jeremiah into business with him, and in May, 1878, bought his interest back.  Since that time he has conducted the business alone.\n\n            Our subject has invested quite largely in real-estate.  He has 1,100 acres of land located two miles and a half south of Red Bluff on Red Bank, 900 acres of which are being cultivated.  On Payne's Creek he has 800 acres, a part of which he rents and the remainder is devoted to fruit, etc.  He also owns 2,120 acres of land on Red Bank that at some future time will be quite valuable.  In 1859 he built his present brick store, 25 x 105 feet.  He has also built for himself and family a beautiful residence on High street, between Oak and Pine.\n\n            Mr. Schoenfeld was married in 1878, to Miss Helena Myer, a native of San Francisco and a daughter of Nathan Myer, of that city.  They have two children, a son and daughter:  David S., born in San Francisco, and Golda S., in Red Bluff.\n\n            In politics Mr. Schoenfeld is liberal, always casting his vote for whom he considers to be the best man.  He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, the blue lodge and chapter.  He has held the office of Scribe and holds now the office of King.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{FBD774C3-21CF-4F27-8F79-631D3257A050}","objects_refno":"2008.01.01.00011","objects_customfield_6":"Memorial & Biographical History of Northern California, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1891 pg. 550-551","objects_customfield_5":"Schoenfeld, Jonas / Schoenfeld, Salomen D.","objects_objtype":"Receipt","objects_date":"1/1/1877","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Nine receipts from various merchants to Jonas Schoenfeld acting on behalf of his brother, Salomen D.

Wayne received this plantation for service to the revolution. He was never out of debt and eventually lost it.\n\n\n\nCohen was a merchant in Savannah and fought in the Revolutionary War. He is no doubt acting as an intermediary to the Dutch. Philip Jacob Cohen  along with Mordecai Sheftall, Levi Sheftall, Philip Minis, and Sheftall Sheftall were in the first days of the Revolution disqualified by the authorities from holding any office of trust in the province because of the pronounced revolutionary ideas which they advocated.\n\n\n\nA Revolutionary war hero, Wayne was often called _��Mad Anthony_ѝ because of his courage on the battlefield. He fought in numerous important battles during 1775-78 and demonstrated his military excellence in his surprise attack on and capture of Stony Point in 1779. In 1780 his quick action prevented a British seizure of West Point after Benedict Arnold_��s betrayal of the post. In 1783, General Wayne retired from active military service. In gratitude for his part in subduing the hostile Indians in Georgia, the state of Georgia gave him an 800-acre rice plantation. He borrowed the necessary capital to work it from Dutch creditors, who subsequently foreclosed on the land. \n\n\n\nWayne was from Pennsylvania and was a member of the Pennsylvania council of censors in 1783, where he favored a new constitutional convention being called. He was a representative of Chester County to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1784 and 1785, and in 1787, he supported the new federal Constitution at the convention in Philadelphia. After serving as a member from Georgia of the U. S. House of Representatives, Wayne was appointed major general by President George Washington in order to pacify the Indians of the Ohio Valley. He defeated the Indians at the battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, obtaining their complete submission and surrender with the Treaty of Greenville in August 1795.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{8931D4FD-9BE5-4061-BAA6-C59E3C5659E9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03983","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03983","objects_customfield_5":"COHEN, PHILIP JACOB","objects_objtype":"DEMAND NOTE","objects_date":"6/9/1785","objects_coltype":"MONETARY","descript_1":"This signed note by General Anthony Wayne in Savannah, Georgia is to Philip Jacob Cohen in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Canojoharie NY area of the Erie Canal. \n\n\n\nOne of the most common businesses along the Erie Canal was the general store. Canal stores could be found practically every time you turned around. By its very nature the Erie Canal created a group of ready-made customers for anyone who had the opportunity to serve their needs.\n\n\n\nOnce a barge or packet boat entered the canal, that boat was limited as to where it could go. That is, it was stuck to moving only on the canal. The boat itself was limited as to what it could carry. As much space as possible was needed for the cargo, whether it be wheat, carpets or people. Many supplies had to be obtained while the boat was in route on the canal. Stores provided those supplies \n\n\n\n\nSEE PHOTO IN Condition.  The items in this display are all typical of merchandise found in Erie Canal Stores and date from the middle 1800s. The crockery is from the Cohen's Big Canal Store in Sprakers Basin, Montgomery County.\n\n\n\nErie Canal stores could vary widely in their sizes and ambitions. They would run from the rather modest Putman's Lock Stand, through the more standard sized Brown's Cash Store and larger Cohen's Big Canal Store, up to the largest emporiums that could be found in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. Cohen's even advertised their own brand of washing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{7EA8108C-F37C-4541-9978-760E3C80F862}","objects_refno":"2009.12.15.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2009.12.15.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Cohen, Simon / Cohen, Henry","objects_objtype":"Broadside","objects_date":"7/1/1861","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"1861 Tracy's Linament for Erie Canal boatmen broadside","person_nam":"Cohen, Simon","person_n_1":"Cohen, Henry","corporatio":"","merger":"Cohen, Henry | Cohen, Simon","location":"Sprakers Basin, NY","date":"1861-07-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"NY 409","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_ny_409_1r.tif; doc_ja_ny_409_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.279269,33.49682]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2662,"longitude":-81.27926851,"latitude":33.49681986,"ref_1":"ref2687","ref_2":"cid4639367","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Letters","descriptio":"This highly unusual one and one-half letter by John Belton O'Neal, Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court, writes to Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia as Editor of The Occident in 5/9/1847.

C.; died in Sumter, S. C., Dec. 9, 1902. He married Esther Lyon of Petersburg, Va., in 1854. In 1856 he opened a law-office in Columbus, Ga. When the Civil war began he organized a company of 120 men, 50 of whom he mounted and equipped at an expense of $10,000-the whole of his fortune. This company bore his name until it became Company A, 7th Confederate Cavalry, with Mo��se as its captain; in 1863 he became major of the regiment, and was in command of it at the end of the war; he had not received his colonel's commission, but he had been recommended for promotion after the battle of Burgess' Mills, and the recommendation had been approved by General Lee. He fought in all the battles of the army of northern Virginia under General Lee, was slightly wounded at Gettysburg, had three horses killed under him in the battles below Petersburg, and was with Hampton in his raid and capture of Kilpatrick's camp. With 200 of his men he built the dams at Hatch's Run which protected Lee's left flank against Grant, and at Smithfield, N. C., in 1865, he performed the service of burning the bridges in the retreat of Generals Hampton and Butler from Bentonville to Raleigh. He surrendered with Gen. Joseph Johnston at Greensboro, N. C.\n\n\n\nEdwin Mo��se emerged from the war penniless and settled in Sumter, S. C., where he practised law with success. He was largely instrumental in redeeming South Carolina from radical rule in 1876, giving up his practise to cooperate with Hampton for that purpose. He was nominated as adjutant-and inspector-general of his state on the same ticket with Hampton, receiving more votes than his leader. Reelected in 1878, he served four years and declined renomination in 1880. He gave the whole of his first term's salary to the public schools of his state. He was a delegate to the Reconstruction Convention in 1865, was presidential elector in 1880, and was repeatedly sent as a delegate to various state conventions.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{DCDBB291-5DBB-4E81-9CF3-2A03454AE8D7}","objects_refno":"2007.04.16.00002","objects_customfield_6":"Concise Dictionary of American Jewish Biography","objects_customfield_5":"MoÌøse, Captain E.

He was considered the most prominent Jew in Missouri during the 19th century. One of the prominent characters in St. Louis during the Civil War was Isidor Busch, a wine-merchant. He was one of the delegates on the Unconditional Union Ticket to a convention which decided that Missouri should remain in the Union.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 15 he became involved in the printing business and began the study of foreign languages. He soon became part owner of Schmid & Bush, which became one of Vienna's largest publishers. When the Revolution of 1848 failed he had to flee to New York, where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849 and opened a small stationery and bookstore in New York. His weekly journal Israel's Herold failed after only three months.\n\n\n\n He moved to St. Louis the same year, where he opened a general store while continuing to write articles for various journals. In 1870 he organized the firm of Isidor Bush & Company, which became one of the most successful wine and liquor enterprises in St. Louis. He also became the general passenger agent and auditor for the St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railroad Company and served as president of Peoples' Savings Bank in St. Louis. Bush was closely associated with B'nai B'rith and helped to develop the B'nai B'rith Cleveland Orphans Home as well as developing several national insurance and endowment programs for the organization. Bush served as secretary to General John Fremont during the Civil War and also served on the St. Louis Board of Education and the City Council. He attended several state conventions during the Civil War period as a delegate from St. Louis and was a strong opponent to slavery. \n\n\n\nLater in life Bush became interested in viticulture. He purchased a tract of land (named by him Bushberg) outside the city, which became noted for its products. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, The Bushberg Catalogue, which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{F9800A37-CF8A-415E-AC57-9ABAC97F3896}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03753","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03753","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / BUSH, ISIDOR (1822.1898)","objects_objtype":"LETTER / STAMPLESS","objects_date":"5/6/1857","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter from Isidor Bush in St. Louis, Missouri to Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in which Bush asks Leeser to look over an article.

During the last holy-days, the Synagogue was crowded almost to suffocation, not less than from five to six hundred persons being present, whereas, but a few years back, they could count scarcely more than about fifty or sixty. They have been likewise fortunate in engaging the services of the Rev. Nathan Davidson, who acts both as Hazan and Shochet, a fact which renders his labours more than usually arduous. Mr. Myers speaks of his capacity in the highest terms, and having witnessed the service at London and New York, thus having no mean standard of comparison, he avers that Mr. Davidson's manner is not surpassed even there; and he informs us accordingly that every one left the house of prayer perfectly satisfied with what he had heard and seen. There is also, as Mr. Myers writes us, a German Synagogue in St. Louis, which will soon become an important body, since there is a constant increase in the Jewish population. They have also two benevolent societies in a flourishing condition, and they talk about orga�_nizing another one; we are promised the details of its progress. All these facts speak for themselves, that there is great cause for hope, and little ground for despair of our progress in the United States.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{7213331B-150D-491B-BA2B-2B93951231F3}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.03498","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.03498","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / MYER, HENRY","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"11/6/1849","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Religious Related","descript_1":"A letter from Henry Myer, as Secretary of the United Sheba Congregation of St. Louis, Missouri, to Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia.

Here, Harris decries J.T. Montgomery, Captain of the Jeff Davis Flying Artillery, for being a drunk, and asks Jefferson Davis to endorse a forced resignation of the Captain and for charges to be pressed. The Jeff Davis Flying Artillery, originally formed in Selma, Alabama in June of 1861, fought in most of the army's major engagements including Antietam, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. Letter reads in part, Dear sir, Why is it that the Confederacy is stabbed & the Jeff Davis Flying Artillery is murdered by reinstating such a man as J.T. Montgomery. He is a broken down school-master & a drunken preacher��_Montgomery has no fitness for the office��_Montgomery has the imprudence, presumption & perseverance of Satan��_Every friend of the Country implores you to remove the man & save the Company��_\n\n\n\n Jefferson Davis autograph note signed on the verso of the letter, as Confederate President, dated 5 February 1862 and also includes an autograph note signed by Secretary of War Judah Benjamin, dated 6 February 1862. Richmond, Virginia was the Capital of the Confederacy. Clearly this document passed Jefferson Davis' desk on to Judah Benjamin's on the same day. \n\n\n\nDavis' endorsement, written lengthwise on verso, reads, This letter contains charges which though general require attention / Let the case be referred to Genl. Johnston / Jeff. Davis. The ink in both Davis' endorsement and his signature is very light. Also includes an autograph note signed by Secretary of War Judah Benjamin, dated 5 February 1862: Prefer charges against Capt. J.T. Montgomery��_ Letter, measuring 8 x 12, runs two pages on lined paper, front and verso. Some show through from writing and minor foxing throughout, else near fine condition. Letter is housed in a 10.5 x 15.25 slipcase with cloth boards and a blue leather back strip.\n\n\n\nThis is a scarce document for two fold, 1st it is unusual to see a military discipline matter signed by both the President and the Secretary of War; secondly Judah Benjamin was Secretary of War for only seven months September 17, 1861 - March 24, 1862). Benjamin became a lightning-rod for popular discontent with the Confederacy's military situation, and quarreled with the Confederate Generals P.G.T. Beauregard and Stonewall Jackson. He had strong disagreements with Davis about how to conduct the war. The military issues were highlighted by the Confederate's loss of Roanoke Island to the Union without a fight in February 1862. Benjamin was held responsible for the loss (although he was carrying out Davis' priorities), and the public was outraged. Rather than reveal the pressing shortage of military manpower that had led to the decision to concede Roanoke, Benjamin accepted Congressional censure for the action without protest and resigned. As a reward for Benjamin's loyalty, Davis appointed him as Secretary of State in March 1862.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{97704C4C-7671-4624-834A-65479860E99C}","objects_refno":"2011.12.15.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2011.12.15.00001","objects_customfield_5":"BENJAMIN, JUDAH P. / Davis, Jefferson","objects_objtype":"LETTER","objects_date":"1/30/1862","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Civil War","descript_1":"Letter, written by Joseph Harris, dated January 30th, 1862 from Summerville, South Carolina, asking Jefferson Davis to endorse the forced resignation of Captain J.T.

Henry accusing Leeser of a series unfounded personal attacks, ever since the writer landed in America, that threatens his reputation and livelihood. From Kursheedt's letter It would seem that Leeser battles with Henry started after he was in Cincinnati (is it possible that Leeser had suggested the New Orleans position to him and he instead took the Cincinnati position thereby undercutting Leeser's role as king maker). It should be noted that when Henry resigned his Cincinnati post in July 1852, the Congregation gave him a fine testimonial and recommendation_�_all of which Leeser published in the Occident.

E. Levy re: land in Levy County. It was written from Miconopy, Florida.  A pioneer Jewish settler of Florida, he came in 1821. He was a visionary exponent of Jewish colonization and educational schemes. Signed documents by this famous pioneer are scarce.\n\n\n\nBorn in Morocco in 1781, Moses E. Levy was the son of a Moroccan government minister. After the Sultan's death in 1790, Morocco experienced an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence and the Levy family fled to Gibraltar. There, at the age of 15, while praying at a synagogue, Levy had a revelation, he later wrote, surpassing the idea of hellfire A according to historian Chris Monaco, During this episode . . . Moses Levy 'swore never to doubt the Bible.' While most of 19th-century American Jewry took a lax approach to religious observance, Levy remained staunchly traditional, keeping the Sabbath and observing kashrut. In 1800, the death of Levy's father and a yellow fever epidemic forced Moses, his mother and his infant sister to leave Gibraltar for the Danish Virgin Islands, where they joined a thriving Jewish community. Three years later, at age 22, he became partners in a lumber business with Philip Benjamin, father of U.S. Senator and Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. Levy subsequently moved to Puerto Rico, where he became a munitions contractor and, after separating from his wife, moved to Cuba, where he built a fortune in shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in Cuba, Levy decided to use his wealth to purchase a tract of land near Micopany in Spanish Florida, which was soon ceded to the United States. Levy built houses and dug wells in hopes of attracting European Jews living under oppressive conditions. Jews in the Diaspora needed a homeland, he observed, because no amelioration can be expected at the hands of nations for us. He argued, The race of Jews has miraculously been continued unmixed with the people of the nations through which they have been scattered and warned that every Jew who contributes to the . . . amalgamation of the House of Israel is an enemy to his nation, his religion and, consequently, to the world at large. He named his colony Pilgrimage Plantation. Between 1820 and 1824, Levy traveled north to New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk to seek financial support for his plan. Yet, by 1825, few Jews had emigrated from Europe to the wilds of Levy's experimental plantation. Perhaps the fact that hostile Indians, snakes and alligators inhabited Florida discouraged settlers.\n\n\n\nIn 1825, Levy traveled to London, hoping to persuade Jewish philanthropists there to support Pilgrimage Plantation. His pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. Through his willingness to address leading English Christians, however, Levy had an impact on the campaign to reestablish full Jewish rights in England. In 1826, a number of upper-class Christian Londoners took a genuine interest, on liberal grounds, in restoring full political equality to England's Jews, whose rights had been suspended 500 years earlier. Levy addressed reform-minded Christian groups on a number of occasions and impressed them with his learning. The sophisticated yet pious Levy helped dispel the notion among affluent Londoners that all Jews were peddlers living in poverty in London's East End.\n\n\n\nLevy also confronted the evangelical London Society for the Promotion of Christianity among the Jews, challenging their attempts to save the Jewish people through conversion. Ironically, Levy's contacts with evangelicals, whom he opposed on conversion, gave him a voice in the British antislavery movement. Levy had lived with slavery in the Caribbean and Florida. He was listened to with rapt attention on the subject by the leading group of British evangelical abolitionists was known as the Clapham Sect. Because Levy observed the Sabbath, spoke fluent Hebrew and knew the Bible, the Claphamites respected Levy as a lineal descendant of the ancient Hebrews, whose religion, they believed, was the wellspring of Christianity. British abolitionists advocated for immediate emancipation to save the souls of both slave and slave owner. Levy argued that, first, banks and businesses would have to be created to invest in non-slave agriculture and the children of slaves would have to be educated in agricultural techniques. Levy thought it would require a generation of gradual preparation for emancipation. Despite these reservations, Levy was one of the few individuals living in the American South to propose emancipation -even if he was in the relative safety of London when he made his views public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIronically, little that Levy stood for survived his own lifetime. In 1835, Pilgrimage Plantation was burned during the Second Seminole War. Levy's son, David Levy Yulee, later became a United States Senator from Florida, the first Jewish-born American so elected. Contrary to his father, the younger Levy remained pro-slavery and rejected his Jewish identity. Nevertheless, Moses Elias Levy proved a visionary in predicting that, one day, Florida would make an excellent home for Diaspora Jews to settle in.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CB81FE0C-10BA-4A3E-96E6-AD90ED8BBB14}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.02615","objects_customfield_6":"NUMEROUS","objects_customfield_5":"LEVY, MOSES ELIAS (1782.1854)","objects_objtype":"Letter","objects_date":"2/14/1853","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"Florida political history","person_nam":"Yulee, David Levy","person_n_1":"Westcott, James","corporatio":"","merger":"Westcott, James | Yulee, David Levy","location":"Tallahassee, FL","date":"1853-02-14T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"FL 40","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_fl_40_1r.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_1r.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_1v.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_2r.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_2v.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_3r .tif; doc_ja_fl_40_3r.tif; doc_ja_fl_40_3v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":null,"properties":{"cartodb_id":2928,"longitude":0,"latitude":0,"ref_1":"ref3514","ref_2":"cid4638545","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Official documents","descriptio":"Evans, M.

It is distinct from Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral law, the legal decisions of the Sanhedrin as codified in the Talmud and subsequent works to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah, without additional Oral Law or explanation.

Edwards, Dept. of War,  he was also Commisioner of Pensions\n\n\n\nMajor Alfred Mordecai was born in Warrentown, North Carolina, in 1804 and died in 1887. He entered West Point at age 15 and he graduated first in his class in 1823. Upon graduation, Mordecai became an assistant professor at the United States Military Academy in New York. Later, he was commissioned in the engineers and was involved in the construction of two forts in Virginia. Eventually, he became commander of the Washington Arsenal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMordecai was recognized for his meritorious service in the line of duty during the Mexican War (1845-1847) with his promotion to Major. When the war was over, he was sent to Mexico to adjust claims for losses suffered by Mexicans during the conflict. The military sent him and Captain George B. McClellan, who became one of the top generals in the Civil War, to observe the Crimean War in 1854. They were granted a private conference with Czar Nicholas I and Mordecai's observations were published by Congress. Mordecai made important contributions to the military technology with his introduction of scientific research and development to the military art. He wrote several notable books on the military, which included Second Report of Experiments in Gun Powder (1849) and Ordinance Manual for the Use of Officers of the United States Army (1841, revised in 1850). \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Civil War between the states broke out in 1861, it created a dilemma for him. He was tom with his love for the South, his distaste for secession and his loyalty to the army and country. Mordecai made a decision to retire from the U.S. Army at age 57, so he wouldn't have to fight against either side. His devotion to his conscience probably cost him a higher place in American history. When he resigned, he was one of the best military professionals in the country. He was on a par with all the well-known generals of the Civil War. His son, Alfred Mordecai, Jr., whose feelings were less sensitive to his Southern heritage, joined the North in the Civil War in 1861. He died with the rank of General in 1920. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{768733B9-3381-423D-A64F-426AA8CB5941}","objects_refno":"2009.06.21.00002","objects_customfield_6":"See Condition  for a scan of his bio","objects_customfield_5":"MORDECAI, ALFRED CAPTAIN","objects_objtype":"Envelope","objects_date":"10/20/1839","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Military Pre.Civil War","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Mordecai, Alfred","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Mordecai, Alfred","location":"Washington, DC","date":"1839-10-20T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Revolutionary War","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"29","tiff_locat":"doc_rw_29_1r.tif; doc_rw_29_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.146669,31.54933]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2787,"longitude":-97.14666947,"latitude":31.54932968,"ref_1":"ref241","ref_2":"cid4641798","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"ASD Paid M.L in poor script\n\n","thing_uuid":"{0FE5A18E-DB34-4BFA-8B86-26B0D42A1BB1}","objects_refno":"2008.09.05.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2008.09.05.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Baruch, A., Brochfeld, B.","objects_objtype":"BILLHEAD","objects_date":"10/1/1874","objects_coltype":"DOCUMENT..Commercial","descript_1":"","person_nam":"Baruch, A.","person_n_1":"Brochfeld, B.","corporatio":"","merger":"Brochfeld, B. | Baruch, A.","location":"Waco, TX","date":"1874-10-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Billheads Pre-1880","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"TX 3010","tiff_locat":"doc_bhe_tx_3010_1r.tif; doc_bhe_tx_3010_1v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.146669,31.54933]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2788,"longitude":-97.14666947,"latitude":31.54932968,"ref_1":"ref874","ref_2":"cid4641170","genre":"Documents","genre_subl":"Billheads","descriptio":"Austin Avenue also 66 Lispenard St., NYC","thing_uuid":"{D63A83A9-8B84-40AD-82E6-F4FDDAFDC006}","objects_refno":"2008.08.31.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2008.08.31.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Lindenthal, A. / Solomon, J.

His father, Moses Elias Levy, bought 50,000 acres of land near present-day Jacksonville to establish a New Jerusalem for Jewish settlers. \n\n\n\nAfter studying and practicing law in St. Augustine, David Levy became the delegate to United States Congress for the Florida Territory and was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate when Florida was admitted to the Union in 1845. In 1846, he officially changed his name to David Levy Yulee (adding his father's ancestral Sephardic surname). After serving one term in the Senate, Yulee was defeated for re-election in 1850.\n\n\n\nThe next year, he founded a 5,000-acre (20 km2) sugar plantation along the Homosassa River. While living in Fernandina, he began to follow his dream to build a railroad across Florida. He had originally planned to build a state-owned system as far back as 1837, but in 1851, he became the first southerner to utilize federal grants by drawing up an Internal Improvement Act. Using federal and state land grants and public stock. The Florida Railroad was chartered in 1853. The terminals would be the deep water ports, Fernandina on Amelia Island on the Atlantic side and Cedar Key on the Gulf. Construction began in 1855 and on March 1, 1861, the first train arrived in Cedar Key, just weeks before the beginning of the Civil War.\n\n\n\nElected to the Senate again in 1855, he served until January 21, 1861, when he withdrew from the Senate after Florida seceded to join the Congress of the Confederacy.

Henry Deyo challenges Myers, his superior officer to a duel 4/15/1813 letter (2) In a signed letter , Myers accepts the challenge 4/16/1813 and in (3) a signed letter in Myers hand, he spells out the terms of the duel 5/13/1813. Five years after this lot was purchased a fourth letter 5/23/1813 was located and placed in the Collection_�_it related to a delay in the dual due to the Battle of Niagra Falls (see 20.762a). After this letter nothing more is known other than about one week later Lt. Henry Deyo resigns and leaves the Army..did he lose his nerve?.\n\n\n\nThe value of these three letters is combined with 20.762a\n\n\n\n_��The fatal duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr shocked the nation. But it was the identity of the man killed, not the fact of the duel itself, that produced such dismay. By 1804, dueling had become an American fixture. And for another thirty years or more, its popularity would continue to grow. \n\n\n\nLike many early American customs, dueling was imported. Starting in the Middle Ages, European nobles had defended their honor in man-to-man battles. An early version of dueling was known as judicial combat, so called because God allegedly judged the man in the right and let him win. In an era known for its bloody encounters, judicial combats probably prevented men from killing in the heat of passion. Still, numerous authorities, including heads of state and the Catholic Church, banned dueling -- with little effect. \n\n\n\nIn 1777, a group of Irishmen codified dueling practices in a document called the Code Duello. The Code contained 26 specific rules outlining all aspects of the duel, from the time of day during which challenges could be received to the number of shots or wounds required for satisfaction of honor. An Americanized version of the Code, written by South Carolina Governor John Lyde Wilson, appeared in 1838. Prior to that, Americans made do with European rules. \n\n\n\nIn a typical duel, each party acted through a second. The seconds' duty, above all, was to try to reconcile the parties without violence. An offended party sent a challenge through his second. If the recipient apologized, the matter usually ended. If he elected to fight, the recipient chose the weapons and the time and place of the encounter. Up until combat began, apologies could be given and the duel stopped. After combat began, it could be stopped at any point after honor had been satisfied. \n\n\n\nEdward Doty and Edward Lester, of the Massachusetts colony, fought the first recorded American duel in 1621, just a year after the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth. Armed with swords, both men sustained minor wounds. A unique aspect of this duel was that Doty and Leicester were servants. For the most part, only gentlemen dueled. \n\n\n\nMost duelists chose guns as their weapons. The large caliber, smoothbore flintlock pistols Hamilton and Burr used in their encounter typified the American dueling weapons. Many American men owned a pair of such pistols, and, from about 1750 to 1850, many were called to use them. \n\n\n\nThe chance of dying in a pistol duel was relatively slim. Flintlocks often misfired. And even in the hands of an experienced shooter, accuracy was difficult. Generally, pistols had to be discharged within three seconds; to take aim for a longer time period was considered dishonorable. \n\n\n\nIn an 1802 duel, DeWitt Clinton was challenged by John Swartwout, a friend of Aaron Burr. Swartwout accused Clinton of trying to ruin Burr with political smears. The men exchanged five rounds. After each round, as the code provided, seconds encouraged the combatants to mend their differences. Clinton adamantly refused to sign a letter of apology. Swartwout, despite being shot in the thigh and ankle, refused to quit. Unwilling to continue shooting at a wounded man, an exasperated Clinton left the field. Surgeons standing at the ready tended Swartwout's wounds. \n\n\n\nIn America, duels were fought by men from all walks of life. But many of America's most important citizens defended their honor on the dueling grounds. Button Gwinnet, who had signed the Declaration of Independence, was shot down by General Lachlan McIntosh in a duel. Commodore Stephen Decatur of the United States Navy, an experienced duelist, died at the hands of another commodore, James Barron. And Abraham Lincoln narrowly averted a battle with swords by apologizing to an Illinois state official he had ridiculed in a local newspaper. \n\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin and George Washington were among the most prominent Americans to condemn dueling. Franklin called duels a murderous practice_�_they decide nothing. And Washington, who undoubtedly needed all the good soldiers he could get, congratulated one of his officers for refusing a challenge, noting that there are few military decisions that are not offensive to one party or another. Religious and civic officials worked hard to stop duels. But diatribes such as Reverend Mason Weems' illustrated pamphlet God's Revenge Against Dueling did little to change public sentiment. Anti-dueling ordinances also failed to stop the flow of blood. Duelists ignored or evaded such laws. In fact, the most popular dueling ground in America was at Bladensburg, Maryland, near the nation's capital. Dueling was banned in Washington, but not in Maryland, which was a short carriage ride away. Irate legislators could simply shuttle out to Bladensburg and fire at will. \n\n\n\nDue to the partisan nature of their work, politicians frequently received challenges -- as did newspaper editors and attorneys. As a young man, attorney Andrew Jackson, future president of the United States, earned a reputation as a formidable duelist. His honor suffered, however, after a duel against Charles Dickinson in 1806. \n\n\n\nDickinson fired his pistol, slightly wounding Jackson. Jackson's weapon misfired -- which according to dueling rules counted as a shot. Technically, the duel should have ended there. But Jackson coldly pulled his hammer back again and fired, this time killing Dickinson. In the eyes of many, Jackson's behavior amounted to little more than murder. \n\n\n\nBy the time of Hamilton and Burr's deadly encounter, dueling had begun to decline -- at least in the North. In the South, where the chivalrous novels of Walter Scott held sway, dueling remained the preferred way to defend one's honor -- or even to commit murder. A jilted lover need only wait for a rival's insult, or even manufacture one. He was then free to challenge and kill the rival without condemnation. \n\n\n\nSome men -- accurate shots in particular -- practically made careers of the duel. Among these men was Alexander McClung, who once killed an opponent at over 100 feet with a smoothbore pistol. This remarkable shot -- and subsequent killings at shorter distances -- honed McClung's fearful reputation. Yet it was said that he was haunted by the ghosts of his victims, and maybe this was so. The last man McClung killed with a pistol was himself, in 1855. \n\n\n\nFor every man who gloried in the duel, there were many others who feared it. A word or two passed in private company on a Friday night could well mean a challenge on Saturday morning and death on Sunday. Avoiding a challenge wasn't easy. Particularly in the South, where men who refused to duel would be posted. A statement accusing them of cowardice would be hung in public areas or published in a newspaper or pamphlet. \n\n\n\nWhen Congressman John Randolph of Virginia refused to meet General James Wilkinson in a duel, a furious Wilkinson posted him. The post declared In justice to my character I denounce to the world John Randolph, a member of Congress, as a prevaricating, base, calumniating scoundrel, poltroon, and coward. Wilkinson, a co-conspirator in Aaron Burr's treason plot, had little character to damage. Randolph lost little by his posting. \n\n\n\nBy the time of the Civil War, dueling had begun an irreversible decline, even in the South. Not surprisingly, public opinion, not legislation, caused the change. What once had been a formal process designed to avoid violence and amend grievances had deteriorated into cold-blooded murder. People at last were shocked by it, and they showed their disdain. It may have been too late to save Alexander Hamilton. But if American was to become a truly civilized nation, the publicly sanctioned bloodshed would have to end._�� -pbs.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_��The fatal duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr shocked the nation. But it was the identity of the man killed, not the fact of the duel itself, that produced such dismay. By 1804, dueling had become an American fixture. And for another thirty years or more, its popularity would continue to grow. \n\n\n\nLike many early American customs, dueling was imported. Starting in the Middle Ages, European nobles had defended their honor in man-to-man battles. An early version of dueling was known as judicial combat, so called because God allegedly judged the man in the right and let him win. In an era known for its bloody encounters, judicial combats probably prevented men from killing in the heat of passion. Still, numerous authorities, including heads of state and the Catholic Church, banned dueling -- with little effect. \n\n\n\nIn 1777, a group of Irishmen codified dueling practices in a document called the Code Duello. The Code contained 26 specific rules outlining all aspects of the duel, from the time of day during which challenges could be received to the number of shots or wounds required for satisfaction of honor. An Americanized version of the Code, written by South Carolina Governor John Lyde Wilson, appeared in 1838. Prior to that, Americans made do with European rules. \n\n\n\nIn a typical duel, each party acted through a second. The seconds' duty, above all, was to try to reconcile the parties without violence. An offended party sent a challenge through his second. If the recipient apologized, the matter usually ended. If he elected to fight, the recipient chose the weapons and the time and place of the encounter. Up until combat began, apologies could be given and the duel stopped. After combat began, it could be stopped at any point after honor had been satisfied. \n\n\n\nEdward Doty and Edward Lester, of the Massachusetts colony, fought the first recorded American duel in 1621, just a year after the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth. Armed with swords, both men sustained minor wounds. A unique aspect of this duel was that Doty and Leicester were servants. For the most part, only gentlemen dueled. \n\n\n\nMost duelists chose guns as their weapons. The large caliber, smoothbore flintlock pistols Hamilton and Burr used in their encounter typified the American dueling weapons. Many American men owned a pair of such pistols, and, from about 1750 to 1850, many were called to use them. \n\n\n\nThe chance of dying in a pistol duel was relatively slim. Flintlocks often misfired. And even in the hands of an experienced shooter, accuracy was difficult. Generally, pistols had to be discharged within three seconds; to take aim for a longer time period was considered dishonorable. \n\n\n\nIn an 1802 duel, DeWitt Clinton was challenged by John Swartwout, a friend of Aaron Burr. Swartwout accused Clinton of trying to ruin Burr with political smears. The men exchanged five rounds. After each round, as the code provided, seconds encouraged the combatants to mend their differences. Clinton adamantly refused to sign a letter of apology. Swartwout, despite being shot in the thigh and ankle, refused to quit. Unwilling to continue shooting at a wounded man, an exasperated Clinton left the field. Surgeons standing at the ready tended Swartwout's wounds. \n\n\n\nIn America, duels were fought by men from all walks of life. But many of America's most important citizens defended their honor on the dueling grounds. Button Gwinnet, who had signed the Declaration of Independence, was shot down by General Lachlan McIntosh in a duel. Commodore Stephen Decatur of the United States Navy, an experienced duelist, died at the hands of another commodore, James Barron. And Abraham Lincoln narrowly averted a battle with swords by apologizing to an Illinois state official he had ridiculed in a local newspaper. \n\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin and George Washington were among the most prominent Americans to condemn dueling. Franklin called duels a murderous practice_�_they decide nothing. And Washington, who undoubtedly needed all the good soldiers he could get, congratulated one of his officers for refusing a challenge, noting that there are few military decisions that are not offensive to one party or another. Religious and civic officials worked hard to stop duels. But diatribes such as Reverend Mason Weems' illustrated pamphlet God's Revenge Against Dueling did little to change public sentiment. Anti-dueling ordinances also failed to stop the flow of blood. Duelists ignored or evaded such laws. In fact, the most popular dueling ground in America was at Bladensburg, Maryland, near the nation's capital. Dueling was banned in Washington, but not in Maryland, which was a short carriage ride away. Irate legislators could simply shuttle out to Bladensburg and fire at will. \n\n\n\nDue to the partisan nature of their work, politicians frequently received challenges -- as did newspaper editors and attorneys.
