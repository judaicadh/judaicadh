# WARNING: Deprecated package

## Use the official [Leaflet.markercluster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet.markercluster) (with a dot) package instead

It is published and maintained by [danzel](https://www.npmjs.com/~danzel), the
original author of [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
plugin.

```bash
$ npm uninstall leaflet-markercluster --save

# The closest version is 0.3.0:
$ npm install leaflet.markercluster@0.3.0 --save

```


## Explanation

This "unofficial" package has been published by an unknown soul back in 2013.

It has never been updated since then unfortunately.

Whereas the corresponding repository on GitHub has gone through many minor and
major releases, and an "official" npm package has been published and is still
currently maintained.

This `0.2.2` version is actually the same as the `0.2.0` that had been originally
published, but with this modified README.
The change of version is only to be able to publish to npm.

So that users who keep on downloading this `leaflet-markercluster` (with a dash)
package will not suddenly get a broken build, but receive the deprecation notice.
And any future visitor of this page will get the information to use the
"official" package instead.


## New versions

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and
[Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
have gone through many minor and major releases since this "unofficial" package
has been published.

You might be interested in trying leaflet@0.7.7 + leaflet.markercluster@0.5.0,
or leaflet@1.0.3 + leaflet.markercluster@1.0.4 (latest releases as of time of
writing).


## Note about leaflet-engine package

Exact same story applies for [leaflet-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-engine)
package.

It is an "unofficial" package (published by the same unknown soul back in 2013).

You should use the "official" [leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet)
npm package instead. It is published and maintained by the main authors of
Leaflet.
