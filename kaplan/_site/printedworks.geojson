Inside page report on a riot at the the Herkimer Street Synagogue in Albany, New York. This is the firsthand account of the Congregation Beth-El of Albany Affair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY��_..1850 September 7, (1 Tishrei 5611 Rosh Hashana) melee at synagogue (Albany New York)��_.. While Isaac Mayer Wise was serving as Rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Albany New York, he asserted in an address to a reform congregation that he did not believe in the coming of the Messiah nor the resurrection of the dead. Members of the Albany synagogue demanded that he be fired, he refused and forcefully ascended the pulpit. A fistfight broke out which included Wise and the synagogue president. The police had to intervene and close the synagogue. Wise decided to moved to Cincinnati where he founded Congregation Bnai Jeshurum and the first Reform seminary. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Collection houses a letter by Rabbi Isaac Wise where he writes to Isaac Leeser the detail of the arguments at the Beth-El meeting in which he was discharged as rabbi for leading the congregation toward a more liberal path. The letter includes a fight broke out, the sheriff was called and he locked the building. Rabbi Isaac Wise identifies Louis Spanier as the instigator of the whole affair. (see 20-400 as an important earlier letter, 9/8/1850 were the split off Congregation Anshe Emethis formed, additionally see 20-445 where Wise outlines point by point his victory in Court against Louis Spanier )\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch on Wise's Career:\n\nDuring his lifetime Wise was regarded as the most prominent Reform Jew of his time in the United States. His genius for organization was of a very high order; and he was masterful, rich in resources, and possessed of an inflexible will. More than of any of his contemporaries, it may be said of him that he left the impress of his personality upon the development of Reform Judaism in the United States.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWise emigrated to the United States in 1846. He arrived in New York on July 23, and in October was appointed rabbi of the Congregation Beth-El of Albany. He soon began agitating for reforms in the service, and his was the first Jewish congregation in the United States to introduce family pews in the synagogue. A mixed choir, and confirmation were also among the innovations introduced by Wise, who even went so far as to count women in forming a minyan or religious quorum.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAs early as 1848 Wise issued a call to the ministers and other Israelites of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. His call appeared in the columns of the Occident, and was ably seconded by its editor, Isaac Leeser. Wise suggested that a meeting be held in the spring of 1849 at Philadelphia, to establish a union of the congregations of the entire country. This meeting did not take place; but the originator of the idea never ceased advocating it, especially after he had established his own newspaper, The Israelite (July 1854, restyled The American Israelite July 1874), in the columns of which he tirelessly expounded his views upon the subject. His persistence won its reward when in 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 1850, a fistfight between Wise and the synagogue's president caused a split in the Albany community, and the consequent formation of a new congregation, the Anshe Emeth, by the friends and supporters of Wise. Wise remained with this congregation until April, 1854, when he became rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun congregation of the Lodge Street Synagogue of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he officiated for the remaining forty-six years of his life. Wise was above all an organizer, and called numerous institutions into being. He organized the building of the Plum Street Temple in 1866. The temple, noted for its architectural grandeur, was renamed the Isaac M. Wise Temple in his honor.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nHe was indefatigable in insisting upon the pressing need of a theological seminary for the training of rabbis for American pulpits. His indomitable perseverance was crowned with success when, on October 3, 1875, the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students, four of whom were ordained eight years later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nHe lived to see the establishment of the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889, which was the third enduring offspring of his tireless energy and unfailing perseverance. During the last eleven years of his life he served as president of the conference which he had called into existence\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{72A21906-6225-4173-9ECB-FC0BFF87BF2E}","objects_refno":"2010.12.20.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.12.20.00001","objects_customfield_5":"WISE, ISAAC MAYER","objects_objtype":"Providence Daily Journal","objects_date":"9/11/1850","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Article regarding riot in Albany","person_nam":"Wise, Isaac Mayer","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Wise, Isaac Mayer","location":"Albany, NY","date":"1850-09-11T00:00:00Z","container_":"Box","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"9","containe_2":"Object","containe_3":"104","tiff_locat":"bx9_104_1r.tif; bx9_104_1v.tif; bx9_104_2r.tif; bx9_104_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.612188,39.29038]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":191,"longitude":-76.61218816,"latitude":39.29037976,"ref_1":"ref4602","ref_2":"cid4637474","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Periodicals","descriptio":"PAGE 1; THE FIRST JEW IN ALLENTOWN, PA.(MORDECAI); ; ;","thing_uuid":"{05CFF130-B50E-449F-AE0A-DD7B7D32FD12}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04038","objects_customfield_6":"CONSIDER THE YEARS BY J.

Convention was 9/6/1853 & 9/7/1853. \n\n\n\nBeyond the well-known Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, many smaller women_�_s rights and abolitionist conventions were held throughout the antebellum era. This 1853 meeting took place in the Broadway Tabernacle, located just a few blocks north of the American Museum. Participants, who included such prominent reformers as William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Coffin Mott, and William H. Channing, outlined a number of principles and argued that the existence of equal rights would not force all women to exercise them. Channing_�_s reference to Jenny Lind, the _�Swedish Nightingale_� who became famous in the U.S. thanks to P. T. Barnum, suggests the degree to which Barnum_�_s promotion of her as an _�ideal_� woman had permeated the popular consciousness\n\n. \n\nErnestine Rose was born in Poland in 1810. Fleeing an arranged marriage at the age of 16, Rose traveled around Europe, arriving in England in 1830. There, she became a follower of the noted social reformer Robert Owen and honed her skills as a popular public orator.\n\n\n\nRose arrived in America with her husband, a jeweler, in 1836, ready, apparently, for a fight. She learned, soon after her arrival, that a bill proposed to the New York legislature would grant married women the right to control their own property and earnings. Rose drew up a petition, worked for five months to gain supporters, and submitted the first petition (bearing five signatures) on this topic to the state legislature. Passage of New York's Married Women's Property Act was secured in 1848.\n\n\n\nRose became a central figure among woman's rights advocates and a close colleague of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Anthony celebrated Rose_�_s inspiration to the movement, describing her as the _�most eloquent speaker on our platform,_� keeping Rose_�_s portrait over her desk, and adopting her slogan, _�Agitate, agitate._�\n\n\n\nRose attended every national woman's rights convention between 1850 and 1869, serving as president of the fifth national convention in Philadelphia from October 17-19, 1854. In Philadelphia, Rose declared, [I]s woman not included in that phrase, 'all men are created...equal'? ...Tell us, ye men of the nation...whether woman is not included in that great Declaration of Independence?\n\n\n\nRose worked tirelessly traveling to twenty-three states to speak out for women's rights, against slavery and, eventually, for the rights of freed slaves, until she and her husband returned to England in 1869. Rose was not active as a Jew, but she did engage in a published debate in which she attacked anti-Semitism and praised the contributions of Jews throughout history.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{9AEB2AC5-2A47-4996-BF13-9472C0F91634}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04150","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04150","objects_customfield_5":"ROSE, ERNESTINE, L.

Franklin chose to have this letter on Religious freedom printed on the front page of his paper.\n\n\n\nThis important newspaper on religious freedom was in the major traveling exhibit on the life of Franklin. It started in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia and then traveled to St. Louis, Houston, Denver and Atlanta (2006-7). This paper was displayed in all of the cities.\n\n\n\nThe Jewish Naturalization Act 1753 was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain, which received royal assent on 7 July 1753 but was repealed in 1754 due to widespread opposition to its provisions.\n\n\n\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, Sampson Gideon, had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London. Possibly as a reward, Henry Pelham in 1753 brought in the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalized by application to Parliament. It passed the Lords without much opposition, but on being brought down to the House of Commons, the Tories made a great outcry against this abandonment of Christianity, as they called it. The Whigs, however, persisted in carrying out at least one part of their general policy of religious toleration, and the bill was passed and received the royal assent (26 Geo. II., cap. 26).\n\n\n\n On 3rd page is an ad by Myers & Levy detailing items that are for sale; from ship Lydia...

Two on 5/22/1776 for land purchased on 4/25/1775 and 4/30/1774, respectively. This land is Union County adjacent to Center County (Aaronsburg).

The paper was manufactured at Brandywine, Pa.\n\n\n\nThis rare Colonial field notes diary may well be the earliest existent surveys done for Aaron Levy. This land speculation evolved into the founding by Aaron Levy in 1786 Aaronsburg, Pennsylvania. It is the first town in Pennsylvania (and probably in the United States) that was laid out by and named after a Jew. The town's orderly planned and aligned streets were designed that the town might one day be the county seat. This, however never occurred due to the lack of water. The current county seat is Bellefonte.\n\n\n\nAaron Levy was a Revolutionary patriot; founder of Aaronsburg, Pa.; born in Amsterdam in 1742; died in Philadelphia Feb. 23, 1815. He went to America at an early age and settled in Pennsylvania, his name appearing in the first tax-assessment lists of Northumberland County. He engaged in trade with the Indians and furnished supplies to the proprietary government, and, during the war of the Revolution, to the colonial army. In 1778 Levy signed a memorial of the inhabitants of Northumberland county asking help on account of the British and Indian ravages in the vicinity. In the same year he removed to Lancaster, engaging in business with Joseph Simon. He speculated in land in Pennsylvania, and soon became one of the largest landed proprietors, owning immense tracts in nearly every county in the state.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{92BE3D89-10BD-4A71-A96F-2AB088820BCD}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00806","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.00806","objects_customfield_5":"LEVY, AARON","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/1/1776","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Jews are listed","descript_1":"The field notes diary of John Henderson from 5/22/1776.

Congressional Record 45th Congress 2nd Session. A surgeon in the second Grinnell Arctic Expedition (1853-55). See the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia...G to I ...Page 254\n\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century as an ambitious young country expanded its horizons westward, Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes, a young physician from an Orthodox Quaker family in the rural farmland of Pennsylvania, turned his eyes to the North. As a member of the harrowing American arctic expedition under the command of Dr. Elisha Kent Kane in search of the lost British explorer Sir John Franklin, Hayes became obsessed with making his own mark in the far northern polar regions. He organized his own privately funded voyage to the Arctic in 1860, during which he claimed to have reached a farthest north and to have stood on the edge of the fabled Open Polar Sea, a mythical ice-free zone in the high northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nThrough his own hard fought experiences, combined with the knowledge learned from native Greenlanders or Polar Eskimos, he successfully influenced the course of Arctic discovery, causing perceptive explorers to follow his guidance and lead. Directing the same ambition to humanitarian and social causes, during the devastating U.S. Civil War and as an elected politician in New York State during its Gilded Age, Hayes served the public good for a decade, with accomplishments as far reaching as his Arctic service, but little recognized even during his lifetime. In this book, which draws upon Hayes family papers, the little viewed diaries from Hayes s own expeditions, as well as other unpublished primary sources, the story emerges of a remarkable but forgotten explorer, writer, politician, and humanitarian who epitomized the rugged and restless spirit of adventure and individualism of 19th-century America.

Booklet includes the original engraved illustration (17' x 10.5) of the invention which is in my large folio, separate from the above booklet in which it came. ��_..only known copy.\n\n\n\nA portrait painter, expedition artist, and daguerrotypist, Soloman Carvalho was active in both the eastern and western United States.  He was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and moved with his family to Baltimore in 1828, and in 1835, to Philadelphia, where he was a portraiture student of Thomas Sully.  From 1838 to 1850, he worked as an artist in Philadelphia and was also active in Charleston, Washington DC, and Baltimore where he had a daguerreotype studio and exhibited at the Maryland Historical Society.\n\n\n\nAll during his life both he and his wife were prominent in local and National Jewish affairs. The Collection houses his correspondence with Rabbi Lesser as well as the document was he and 13 other Jewish leaders ask the President of the U.S.A. to join France and the great foreign powers to; condemn the act of the Papal States. Re: Mortara affair.\n\n\n\nFrom 1853 to 1854, he was the official photographer and artist of General John C Fremont's expedition from Missouri to Utah to demonstrate to politicians that the railway route could be followed in winter.  Ten Delaware Indians were also a part of the expedition whose route crossed successive ranges of the Rocky Mountains.  It was a treacherous trip, with their food giving out, and people dying of exhaustion.  All of Carvalho's plates and prints from the trip were destroyed in a fire, but he wrote an account detailing the harsh conditions of the trip.  Titled Adventure in the Far West, it was published in 1857. \n\n\n\nExhausted, he left Fremont and the other at Parawan, Utah, and after a brief recovery period, moved on to Salt Lake City.  There he became a popular portrait artist with subjects including Morman leader Brigham Young.  Later he and Young went on a peace mission to Central Utah to meet with Indian leaders, and Carvalho painted many of their portraits. Leon Watters, the historian of early Utah Jewry, firmly established that there were no practicing Jews in Great Salt Lake City at the time of Carvalho's recuperative residence there, so the photographer, therefore, had no opportunity to return to Jewish life immediately. But once he arrived in Los Angeles, he brought a wealth of energy and experience to bear upon the problems of its small struggling Jewish community. In 1860, Solomon Carvalho settled in New York City, where he was an artist, photographer, and president of the Carvalho Heating and Super-heating Company. Carvalho died May 21, 1897, in New York.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{1BB4FC93-E303-4DBA-BE78-45F354056E16}","objects_refno":"2009.05.24.00012","objects_customfield_6":"Not Listed in Singerman","objects_customfield_5":"Carvalho, S.

Singerman 1996. The first appearance of the Szold Siddur in English, which became one of  the standard prayer books for the  late 19th Century American Reform movement, especially 5 years later with the 1871 edition which was co-edited by Szold with Marcus Jastrow. The Szold siddur follows the Reform movement's choice to censor Korbanot and other assorted references to the Temple and Israel. OCLC lists only 3 copies worldwide (Library of Congress, UMichigan, Hebrew Union College), Notably none in the Northeast, none in Baltimore.\n\n\n\nIn 1859, 2 years prior to advent of the American Civil War,  Szold accepted a call from the Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland) in whose service he remained until his death, first as rabbi and later (after 1892) as rabbi emeritus. He arrived in the United States on September 21, 1859, about a month after his marriage to Sophie Schaar, and immediately took active charge of the congregation. Under his guidance it grew rapidly, and, actuated by his example, it became widely known for its strict observance of Shabbat. Before Szold's arrival the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the Minhag America, (which was the new prayer-book written by Isaac Meyer Wise, a Reform rabbi) on the great fall holy days it reverted to the Minhag Ashkenaz; after much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced a new prayer-book, Abodat Yisrael, which closely followed traditional lines (Wikipedia 2015). \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{726F4A23-96C9-465C-B72D-B8012911F9ED}","objects_refno":"2016.01.28.00001","objects_customfield_6":"only 3 other copy known","objects_customfield_5":"Szold, Benjamin","objects_objtype":"THE ORDER OF PRAYER FOR THE ISRAELITISH","objects_date":"1//1/1865","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"Sermon in memory of Abraham Lincoln","person_nam":"Szold, Benjamin","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Szold, Benjamin","location":"Baltimore, MD","date":"1865-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"MD 242","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_md_242_1r.tif; doc_ja_md_242_1v.tif; doc_ja_md_242_2r.tif; doc_ja_md_242_2v.tif; doc_ja_md_242_3r.tif; doc_ja_md_242_3v.tif; doc_ja_md_242_4r.tif; doc_ja_md_242_4v.tif; doc_ja_md_242_5r.tif; doc_ja_md_242_5v.tif; doc_ja_md_242_6r.tif; doc_ja_md_24","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.612188,39.29038]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":183,"longitude":-76.61218816,"latitude":39.29037976,"ref_1":"ref4266","ref_2":"cid4637807","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Catalogues","descriptio":"CIRCA 1885 FOUR PAGE DETAILED PRICE LIST WITH LITHO OF STORE; 310 LIGHT STREET; I.

Second Edition.\n\n\n\nOne charge is that they piratically and feloniously running away with the schooner George Washington, from the care custody and possession of Uriah Phillips Levy, her master.  This event is listed in Levy's biography.\n\n\n\nIn the pamphlet he gives deposition.\n\n\n\nAlthough Levy came from a long line of merchants, he had always been drawn to the sea. In 1802, at the age of ten, Levy ran away in the middle of the night to join the New Jerusalem as a cabin boy. After returning to Philadelphia for his Bar Mitzvah, Levy was apprenticed for four years to a family friend, John Coulter, a leading Philadelphia ship owner. In 1806 Levy became a seaman on the schooner Rittenhouse where he was known for his egotism. In 1809, after spending two years in navigation school, Levy set sail on two Coulter ships, the Polly and Betsy, as second mate, and then on the Five Sisters. At the end of his apprenticeship, secure in his vast knowledge of ships and sailing, Levy became one-third owner and captain of a schooner called the George Washington in 1811. \n\n\n\nEXCEEDINGLY SCARCE, ORIGINAL 1812 PRINTING OF: A REPORT OF THE TRIAL OF SAMUEL TULLEY & JOHN DALTON, ON AN INDICTMENT FOR PIRACY, COMMITTED JANUARY 21ST, 1812. This important work treatise written by Tulley himself, and printed in Boston by J. Belcher. Both Tulley and Dalton were sentenced to be hung at Roxbury Neck, in South Boston. Author was hung in 1812, the last public execution to be held in Boston, while Dalton got a reprieve on the gallows and went on to become a preacher. Volume is an important work in the annals of American piracy, and few early copies are known to survive.\n\n \n\nText was taken directly from the minutes recorded at the actual trial. Charges levied against the defendants Tully and Dalton were serious indeed: One for Piracy, on the Statute of the United States, passed 30th April, 1790-for piratically and feloniously running away with the schooner George Washington, from the care custody and possession of Uriah Phillips Levy, her master. Another for the Murder of George Cummings, on the high seas, on the 20th day of January last. Another for feloniously scuttling and casting away said vessel on the high seas, on the 21st day of January last, against the provisions of a law of Congress in such case made and provided.\n\n \n\nRiveting text provides a compelling, and at times graphic, account of the trial and its culmination: On Thursday morning, at 11 o'clock, prayers were offered at the State Prison, and the convicts taken under care of the Marshal and his Officers, accompanied by the Sheriff of Suffolk and his Deputies, and conducted to the place of execution, at South Boston. The Rev. Mr. Collier, with his wonted kindness and humanity rode with them in the coach. At the place of execution, the rope was first placed around the neck of Tulley, and in the presence of an immense concourse of spectators, he was launched into the eternal world. Dalton was then taken and his neckcloth removed, the rope fixed, his arms pinioned, the cap drawn over his eyes; an awful moment of anxiety was felt by the assembled crowd, one instant more and he would have followed his companion to the world of spirits; when the Marshal pronounced a Reprieve, by order of the President of the United States... \n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{8172862F-C137-44C3-99FA-B04F8F0631F3}","objects_refno":"2007.09.09.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2007.09.09.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Levy, Uriah P.","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/21/1812","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Jews are listed","descript_1":"A report of the trail of Samuel Tulley and John Dalton, on an indictment for piracy, committed on January 21st, 1812.One of their charges was seizing the schooner George Washington from the care and custody of Uriah P.

Russell was a great-nephew of the British Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschel. He began his career as a child singer in Elliston���s Children���s Opera company. While playing the organ at the Presbyterian church in Rochester, New York he discovered that sacred music, played quickly, makes the best kind of secular music. Old Hundredth, played very fast, became the music for Get out of de way, Ol' Dan Tucker.\n\n\n\nIn an eventful life on both sides of the Atlantic, Russell wrote the songs A Life on the Ocean Wave and the tune to George Morris's poem Woodman, Spare that Tree while living in the United States of America from 1835 to 1841, before settling in London to produce musical extravaganzas until he retired in 1857. Many of his songs championed social causes like abolition, temperance, and reform of mental asylums. In 1841, he returned to England and performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London with instant success. Many of his songs were written to lyrics by Charles Mackay, including There's a Good Time Coming, Cheer, Boys, Cheer, and To The West.\n\n\n\nAfter retirement he lived partly in France, partly in England. His first wife was Christian; his second wife was Jewish and their family (including their son, conductor Sir Landon Ronald) was raised in the Jewish religion. His portrait was painted by the British painter Walter Goodman and displayed at The Grafton Gallery in London in 1897. The Jewish Chronicle of May 21st that year describes the painting as depicting Russell hale and hearty with flowing beard. He published 760 songs!! Russell..died a wealthy stock broker!! A detailed biography, A Life on the Ocean Wave: The Story of Henry Russell by Andrew Lamb, was published by Fullers Wood Press in 2007.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{A9E189C6-5C79-494D-992A-9FC548857F3F}","objects_refno":"2007.08.29.00002","objects_customfield_6":"Not Listed in Singerman","objects_customfield_5":"RUSSELL, HENRY (1812-1900) / NOAH, M.

Russell was a great-nephew of the British Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschel. He began his career as a child singer in Elliston's Children's Opera company. While playing the organ at the Presbyterian church in Rochester, New York he discovered that sacred music, played quickly, makes the best kind of secular music. Old Hundredth, played very fast, became the music for Get out of de way, Ol' Dan Tucker.\n\n \n\n.\n\n\n\nIn an eventful life on both sides of the Atlantic, Russell wrote the songs A Life on the Ocean Wave and the tune to George Morris's poem Woodman, Spare that Tree while living in the United States of America from 1835 to 1841, before settling in London to produce musical extravaganzas until he retired in 1857. Many of his songs championed social causes like abolition, temperance, and reform of mental asylums. In 1841, he returned to England and performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London with instant success. Many of his songs were written to lyrics by Charles Mackay, including There's a Good Time Coming, Cheer, Boys, Cheer, and To The West.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter retirement he lived partly in France, partly in England. His first wife was Christian; his second wife was Jewish and their family (including their son, conductor Sir Landon Ronald) was raised in the Jewish religion. His portrait was painted by the British painter Walter Goodman and displayed at The Grafton Gallery in London in 1897. The Jewish Chronicle of May 21st that year describes the painting as depicting Russell hale and hearty with flowing beard. He published 760 songs!! Russell..died a wealthy stock broker!! A detailed biography, A Life on the Ocean Wave: The Story of Henry Russell by Andrew Lamb, was published by Fullers Wood Press in 2007.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{A4477548-08B1-4B97-9146-6F6BF0D113AE}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04631","objects_customfield_6":"Not Listed in Singerman","objects_customfield_5":"RUSSELL, HENRY / NOAH, M.

Born in a family of Portuguese Sephardic ancestry. he was the most important Jewish lay leader in New York in the pre-Civil War period, and the first Jew born in the United States to reach national prominence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1811, he was appointed by President James Madison as consul at Riga, then part of Imperial Russia, but declined, and, in 1813, was nominated Consul to the Kingdom of Tunis, where he rescued American citizens kept as slaves by Moroccan masters. In 1815, Noah received a stunning blow;[4] in the words of US Secretary of State James Monroe, his religion was an obstacle to the exercise of [his] Consular function. The incident caused outrage among Jews and non-Jews alike. Noah moved to New York, where he founded and edited The National Advertiser, The New York Enquirer (later merged into The Courier and Enquirer), The Evening Star, and The Sunday Times newspapers. In 1819, Noah's most successful play, She Would Be a Soldier, was produced. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his travels to Europe and the Barbary Coast, the sight of Jews' oppressed conditions had left a profound impression on Noah, and he became focused on the need for Jewish emigration to more hospitable shores. \n\n\n\nIn a precursor to modern Zionism, journalist and utopian Mordecai Manuel Noah tried to found a Jewish homeland at Grand Island in the Niagara River, to be called Ararat, after Mount Ararat, the Biblical resting place of Noah's Ark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1825 he helped purchase a 2,500-acre tract of land on Grand Island in the Niagara River near Buffalo. Here he envisioned a Jewish colony to be called Ararat, which would be a temporary haven where Jews from persecuted countries could safely await restoration to their ancient Holy Land. The project, undertaken in Noah's typical highly-publicized style, elicited much interest and discussion, but ultimately was a failure_�_ He had brought with him a cornerstone which read Ararat, a City of Refuge for the Jews, founded by Mordecai M. Noah in the Month of Tishri, 5586 (September, 1825) and in the Fiftieth Year of American Independence. On September 2, soon after arriving in Buffalo from New York, thousands of Christians and a smattering of Jews assembled for a historic event. Noah led a large procession,headed by Masons, a New York militia company, and municipal leaders paraded to St. Paul's Episcopal church [10]. Here, there was a brief ceremony- including a singing of the psalms in Hebrew- the cornerstone was laid on the communion table, and the new proclamation establishing the refuge was read. Proclamation - day ended with music, cannonade and libation. 24 guns, recessional,masons retired to the Eagle Tavern, all with no one ever having set foot on Grand Isle. This was the beginning and the end of Mordecai Noah's venture: he lost heart and returned to New York a couple days later without once having set foot on the island.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the major disappointment of Ararat, Noah regarded Palestine as the only possible homeland for Jews, and frequent lectured and wrote about the subject. His 1844 Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews is one of the most well known works on this topic, in which he expressed ideas that preceded the modern Zionists by more than half a century. In his 1844 Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews Noah proclaimed his faith that the Jews would return and rebuild their ancient homeland and called on America to take the lead in this endeavor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1827-1828, Noah led New York City's Tammany Hall political machine.\n\nHe was a staunch supporter of slavery. He worried that emancipation would threaten the whole country's safety.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{012C8B65-2F92-41CD-8E8D-F110EE331E6F}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04222","objects_customfield_6":"ONLY ONE COPY LOCATED...LIBRARY OF CONGRESS","objects_customfield_5":"NOAH, MORDECAI MANUEL / (1785-1851)","objects_objtype":"BUFFALO PATRIOT","objects_date":"9/20/1825","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Article on page 4 dedicated to Mordecai M.

BY...AN ISRAELITE. Cincinnati: Robinson & Jones. 1848.\n\n \n\nThis scarce pamphlet is the address of 'An Israelite to the Christian World,' asserting that Israelites view with as much concern and regret as devout Christians, the lamentable attempts to instil disbelief in a Divine revelation. Lindo argues that God's Covenant with the Jews has never been intermitted, but has always been and still continues to be in operation. Through the revelation they received at Sinai, the world is indebted for the civilization it now enjoys and will continue to be indebted for the preservation of that civilization. Christianity, he says, was originally a Jewish sect, adhering strictly to the monotheism of the Old Testament, but it has gradually become so perverted as to remove it...from what it was ori ginally.  \n\n \n\nFIRST EDITION.

By Edwin De Leon��_.An address delivered before the two literary societies of the South Carolina College, December, 1845. Published in Columbia, S.C., Printed by A.S. Johnston, 1845.\n\n\n\nReviewed by the Southern Quarterly Review��_.We have neither time nor space to do justice to this beautiful oration. We can only say, that the doctrines advanced in it, social, moral and political, are in keeping with the spirit of the age, and calculated to elevate it not a little. The writer wields a powerful pen ; his imagination is rather active, but, in his boldest flights, he never seems indifferent to the dictates of common sense, and he has a peculiarly vivid perception of the true, the just, the moral and the appropriate. His stylo is nervous and eloquent, and we may, with a very good conscience, recommend it to the youthful, and even the mature, orator, as a fine model. We do not know when we have read a production of the kind, that has gratified and charmed us more.\n\n\n\nDe Leon was born in Columbia, SC of parents Mordecai Hendricks De Leon and Rebecca Lopez. Edwin's father Mordecai De Leon, a physician, removed from Philadelphia to Columbia, South Carolina, and was mayor of that city for several years. De Leon married Ellen Mary Novlan of Rothgar, Ireland, on August 25, 1858, in Somerset, England.\n\n\n\nDe Leon graduated from South Carolina College and studied law, but soon turned to literature and politics. De Leon was a leader of the Young America movement. At the invitation of a committee of Southern members of Congress, De Leon established, in Washington The Southern Press, which had a large circulation during the early fifties. For his services during the Pierce campaign, Pierce appointed him consul-general to Egypt, which position he filled for two terms with marked success. At the commencement of the Crimean War, an order was issued by the Porte expelling all Greeks from the Ottoman dominion. The Greeks in Egypt appealed to De Leon, who took them under the protection of the American flag, guaranteed their good behavior, and insisted that they should not be interfered with. The home government approved his course, and Congress paid him the compliment of ordering the printing of his dispatches. The King of Greece tendered him the grand cross of the Order of San Sauveur, but Leon declined on the ground that it was anti-republican.\n\n\n\nDe Leon rendered conspicuous services in protecting American missionaries at Jaffa, and for this he received for the second time the thanks of the State Department. Through his influence American commerce with Egypt was largely extended and American machinery introduced into that country. It was during his incumbency of the consul-general-ship that he heard of the secession of his native state from the Union. He at once forwarded his resignation. Returning home, he ran the blockade and made his way to New Orleans. Thence he proceeded to Richmond and reported to Jefferson Davis, volunteering for military duty. Davis sent him instead on a confidential mission to Europe to secure the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by foreign powers. De Leon refused any salary or remuneration for his services, but advanced from his own purse considerable sums for the use of the Confederacy. He again ran the blockade, reached Nassau, and arrived in England in July, 1862. As diplomatic agent he was received in the highest circles, both in England and in France, and personally pleaded the cause of the Confederacy with Lord Palmerston and the emperor Napoleon.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{2DA91990-A671-4466-8E17-2937D7E3A978}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01004","objects_customfield_6":"AN AMER.

In 1854, he married Esther Lyon of Petersburg, Virginia, and the next year moved to Columbus, Georgia, where he operated a flour mill, kept books, and studied law with his uncle Raphael J.

Officially named the Mo��se Rangers, the unit fought in North Carolina and Virginia, and teamed up with Major General Wade Hampton in 1864 in what came to be known as the Great Beefsteak Raid. When the South surrendered, Mo��se resettled in Sumter where he built a law practice, went into politics, and wrote for the local newspaper.\n\n\n\nIn 1901, at Charleston, SC on Memorial Day, he gave as an address his lament to the Lost Cause.

Cohen may have followed the Sephardic custom of taking his father's first name as his middle name (just like Mordecai Manuel Noah, whose father was Manuel). As a shamash, Cohen would certainly have needed a luach.   If his father was rabbi, he probably had learned how to make one. According to both Wolf & Whiteman and Rosenbloom's BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY, there is an extant will for Abraham Eliezer Cohen. You might see if AJA has a copy, and if it sheds any light on the issue.\n\n\n\nThanks so much for enriching our knowledge through your wonderful finds and purchases!\n\nBest from house to house -- Jonathan\n\n\n\n\n\n LISTS ALL THE READING PORTIONS; & OBSCURE HOLIDAYS..VERY LEARNED SIGNED ON SEPERATE PAGE G. WETTZELL...LANCASTER; GERSHOM MENDES SEIXAS SERVED M.I AS THE HAZZAN DURING THE REV.\n\n\n\nRabbi Mordechai Torczyner (Rabbi at Congregation Sons of Israel...Allentown) and his wife Caren did the scholarly interuputation. AS follows:\n\n\n\nThe 1778-9 Luach\n\n\n\nAuthorship\n\nA few notes on the author:\n\n1. The author is learned enough to know the Jewish calendar well. He didn't transcribe his information from a more learned source - misspellings (Pages 1, 3, 4, 6, 8) indicate he is working from memory\n\n\n\n2. He appears to be lacking certain information, presumably for lack of higher level sophistication. He includes the Molad, the time when the moon enters its new phase, but he generally breaks it down into Hours and Minutes, omitting Chalakim. Only for Cheshvan (Page 2) does he include Chalakim (and there his number actually appears to be wrong - see Page 2 for elaboration). His interest in the Molad shows his religious observance, though, as does his recording of the Tekufah, the solstice.\n\n\n\n3. He is observant, even to the point of keeping fast days (BHB) that were popular in Europe but are rarely observed in America.\n\n\n\n4. A few nuances in the Luach might give away the writer's country of origin - I'll note these as we encounter them. See Page 2 Note 1 and Page 11 Note 3.\n\n\n\n\nFront Cover\n\n\n\n1.\tFaint 1778 A.D. at top is clearly added later, likely by a Christian; Jews shied away from writing AD\n\n\n\n2.\tThe first bold line says Luach 5539, and may be the work of the author\n\n\n\n3.\tThe next two lines say of the year five thousand, five hundred, nine and thirty, in a cursive Hebrew font. I believe this is added by a different author - the cursive font is used throughout the Luach, and that handwriting doesn't match this one. Note: The cursive font is a direct transcription of text at the bottom of the page, which I will describe in Note 6 below.\n\n\n\n4.\tThere are two lines of block text running orthogonally on the left side of the page; these appear to be later additions. It appears to be a name, possibly Shlomo son of Eliyahu and then a last name. I suspect an unlearned writer, as he appears to have used a final Mem in the middle of Shlomo. \n\n\n\n5.\tThree bold lines of block Hebrew text follow, and they appear to name the author. I believe they read:\n\n\t\t\tAvraham son of the honorable rabbi (Kvod haRav, Rav)\n\n\t\t\tEliezer the righteous Kohen, may Gd protect him\n\n\t\t\tPhiladelphia, Rosh Chodesh Tishrei\n\n\tSome comment is necessary here:\n\n\tOn line 1, the last set of characters is clearly Kaf-Hei-Reish-Reish, a non-word. Jewish texts dating back at least to the 14th century used this set of characters as an acronym for Kvod haRav, Rav preceding the name of a great sage. Further, it was often used to identify a father - X, son of Kvod haRav, Rav Y\n\n\n\n\tOn line 2, the righteous Kohen is denoted with a two-character acronym, Kaf-Tzadi. That stands for Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen. Jews named Katz are generally (but not universally!) Kohanim; they took the acronym as their last name.\n\n\tAlso on line 2, may Gd protect him is also an acronym, Yud-Tzadi-Vav being a known acronym invoking Divine protection. There are many possible formulations for the words contracted therein; selecting one over another would be a matter of pure speculation until we knew more about the author's nationality.\n\n\n\n\tLine 3 is perplexing. Strictly speaking, there is no Rosh Chodesh Tishrei at all! Rosh Chodesh is the first of the month - and the first day of Tishrei is not identified as Rosh Chodesh, but rather as Rosh HaShanah! Further, a colonial Jew observant enough to care about a Luach would not have written it on Rosh haShanah, so what is the significance of the date? If he wants to show that this Luach is for the year, he should write 5539 - as he does on \tthe next line! I can't understand what those words are doing there.\n\n\tIt is clear that this is Abraham son of Eliezer, he is a Kohen, and he may well have been a teacher (more on this later under Authorship) - I suggest you check the identity of the Abraham Eliezer Cohen of Philadelphia, and see if historians might have misidentified his name. The name on this Luach is unmistakable.\n\n\n\n6.\tFollowing those three lines we are treated to two lines of a shorthand font known colloquially as Rashi script, as it was used to publish Rashi's 11th century commentaries to Torah, Prophets and Talmud. The words are Five thousand, five hundred and nine and three. See Note 3 above and Note 3 regarding the inside front cover.\n\n\n\n7.\tBelow that we have someone apparently re-writing the name of the author in a blockier text. Most of the text is obscured, but the legible part on the scan says Avraham son of the honorable rabbi - like the top line in the center text above. I suspect this text was meant to be a copy of the text above. It could be the text of the author, though - the font matches that of the month names, appearing on each page in the Luach.\n\n\n\n\n8.There is a set of three or four characters running perpendicular to the author's name, each time the author's name appears. The text is inked out in both places, and I can't make it out.\n\n\n\nInside Front Cover\n\n\n\n1.\tThe four lines of text on the Inside cover seem to be have been designed around an interesting monogram. The monogram is clearly the frame of a letter Aleph - compare a similar notation appearing twice on the inside back cover. I would have assumed it to be a doodle, perhaps even a monogram for the author of the Luach (whose name begins with Aleph), but it appears to be part of the text in the Inside cover - a text I believe to be later in origin.\n\n\n\n2.\tThe text, which is in a cursive font, reads:\n\n\t\t\tRachel, wife of the distinguished man \n\n\t\t\tYaakov son of Yehoshua\n\n\t\t\tKohen, for Chupah\n\n\t\t\tAnd for good deeds, Amen\n\n\tThis would seem to be a dedication to a recipient of the Luach, and the blessing of Chupah and good deeds are \tstandard blessings for Jewish women.\n\nIt is odd, though - If she isn't yet married then why is she the wife of the distinguished man? And if she is married then why bless her for Chupah? One possible speculation - Jewish marriage consists of two stages, Kiddushin and Nisuin. Kiddushin is the giving of the ring, and begins the marital bond, but the marital bond is not complete until Nisuin, which is the stage under the Chupah. A man and woman who have executed Kiddushin but not Nisuin are considered married - if they wish to separate, they need a religious bill of divorce. Historically, Jews conducted Kiddushin, then wait up to a year while the groom arranged his livelihood, then conclude Nisuin - and this could have been a wedding gift for Kiddushin. \n\n\n\n3.\tThis four line text is not that of the author - its cursive font does not match the cursive font he uses in the Luach itself. However, it does appear to match the cursive font on the cover. Perhaps the gift-giver penned the text on the front as a means of deciphering the Rashi font for the recipient?\n\n\n\nPage One\n\n\n\n1.\tHis format for the Luach is practically identical to the standard format used today - columns listing solar date, Hebrew date, day of the week, and special days and Torah readings.\n\n\n\n2.\tInteresting - He identifies the Shabbat before Yom Kippur as Shabbat Teshuvah. It is generally recognized to be Shabbat Shuvah, so named because of its special Shuvah reading from the Prophets, but it is colloquially termed Teshuvah, meaning repentance, because of its proximity to Yom Kippur.\n\n\n\n3.\tNote that in the left column he includes diagrams to indicate lunar phases\n\n\n\n4.\tMisspelling - He writes Hoshanah with Hei at the end, and it should be an Aleph. The pronounciation does not change.\n\n\n\n5.\tInteresting graphic embellishments of Bereishit and Rosh Chodesh - the Rosh Chodesh curlicue continues in later months, too.\n\n\n\n6.\tWhen he gets to the 30th day of the month - for this and all other 30-day months - he writes out the letter Lamed as Lamed-Mem-Daled.\n\n\n\nPage Two\n\n1.\tWorth noting - he calls the month by the colloquial name Cheshvan, where many Jews would have called it by its technically correct name, Marcheshvan. This may help indicate country of origin.\n\n\n\n2.\tNote inclusion of dates for BHB fasts.\n\n\n\n3.\tHis Chalakim calculation must be wrong. There are 1080 Chalakim in an hour, and he says the Molad takes place in the 28th minute - but at 793 Chalakim!\n\n\n\nPage Three\n\n1.\tSomeone - not the author - wrote Kislev, the name of the month, on the back of the preceding page. It's not the author - the author uses an odd spelling, including a Yud between the Lamed and the Vav.\n\n\n\n2.\tI cannot decipher the note at the bottom of the left-most column.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Four\n\n1.\tHe misspells the name of the Torah portion Vaera, placing a Hei at the end instead of an Aleph\n\n\n\n2.\tText at the bottom left of the page is illegible; is there water damage? Looking at the back of the page, there does appear to be water damage.\n\n\n\nPage Six\n\n1.\tThe author originally misplaced the Fast of Esther, then crossed it out and put it in its proper place\n\n\n\n2.\tThe author mis-wrote Esther, starting it with an Ayin. For an Ashkenazic Jew this won't change the pronounciation, though.\n\n\n\nPage Seven\n\n1.\tNote special notation for the night of the search for Chametz (Bedikah) and the added column for the Omer Date\n\n\n\nPage Eight\n\n1.\tNote the BHB dates appearing again\n\n\n\n2.\tMisspells the Torah portion of Metzora, substituting a Hei for the Ayin that belongs there. For an Ashkenazic Jew this won't change the pronounciation, though.\n\n\n\n3.\tThe back of the previous page contains an inscription in English characters - it seems to say G Wertzel 1779. I don't know what this might have to do with the authorship of the book, or the identity of the gift-giver/recipient. See Page 11, Note 1.\n\n\n\nPage Eleven\n\n1.\tThe back of the previous page contains an inscription:\n\n\t\tG Wettsell\n\n\t\tLancaster\n\n\tSee Page 8, Note 3.\n\n\n\n2.\tThe author writes August as Achustus, whereas the rest of his transliterations of English months are true to the American pronounciation.\n\n\n\n3.\tThe author links the Torah portion of Devarim with Eichah (Lamentations), but Eichah is not read on Shabbat, it's read on the Fast of the Ninth of Av, which is later that week. I do recall hearing that some communities historically read part of Eichah as the portion from the Prophets for the Shabbat of Devarim, and that might provide a clue as to the author's origins.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack Cover\n\nThe back cover has a line of text that appears to be in English characters.\n\nIt also features several Hebrew characters, apparently practice characters or doodles.\n\nIt also features the first seven letters traced out, and the first of them is a letter Aleph that strongly resembles the Aleph monogram on the inside front cover.\n\n\n\nAs per Prof. Jonathan Sarna (3/15/07)...Original message from Jonathan D. Sarna <sarna@brandeis.edu>: -------------- \n\n\n\nDear Arnie,\n\nI have been studying your luach, thanks to some images that the AJA sent me.  As you know, the name -- which seems to me to be in a different hand than the calendar -- is Rachel wife of Jacob son of Joshua.  The only early American Jew I know who fits this description is Rachel Jacobs [Pollak], the second wife of Jacob I. Cohen (whose father was Joshua).  Of course, they only married in 1807, so if I am right the inscription came later. As I recall, there is a listing [by Cyrus Adler] of the library of Jacob I. Cohen.  It might be worth seeing if there is mention there of this luach.  That would confirm my hunch that it comes from that collection.  I do not own the! listin g of Cohen's library, but I bet that HUC does.\n\nWarm regards -- Jo! nathan< BR> \n\n\n\nTo Arthur Kiron (1/10/2011),\n\n\n\n\nThis is the information on Joseph Cohen (1745-1822) that I culled while researching Lewis Cohen (FYI, see Write up on Lewis Cohen below)_�_.The Jews of Lancaster, Pa. by David Brener. It may shed some light on both my Luach and the documents in the Katz Library.\n\nLewis Cohen's father was Joseph Cohen (1745-1822) who came to America in 1768 from Germany via England and clerked for the Gratz Brothers. In 1781 he returned to England and stayed until the 1790's. In 1798 he served as the shohet for Shearith Israel in NYC. By 1799, in Lancaster, Pa., he was listed in the house of Joseph Simon as Household Rabbi . He was listed in the 1791 Lancaster tax records as a shop keeper._�_ Joseph Cohen died in England (1822). \n\n \n\nObservations and areas of further research\n\n1.\tJoseph Cohen's time period with Gratz Brothers would certainly coincide with the time period of the Luach 1777-1778. The Philadelphia then Lancaster sojourn during the Revolution fits\n\n2.The author signs his name as Avraham Son of Eleazer Katz (Cohen)...5539 (1778)...Philadelphia\n\n              a.\tSingerman does not list his father\n\n3.He gave the Luach to Rachael with a blessing to an unmarried girl.\n\n              a.He had a daughter Rachael (no details in Singerman)\n\n4.Rachael Gratz (1764-1831) married Solomon Etting in 1791. His first wife was Reyna (Rachael) Simon in 1783_�_bingo!!! Was it Reyna (Rachael) Simon (1764-1790) who received the Luach????? Therefore do we point more in the direction of Reyna (Rachael) Simon?_�_she was 14 years old in 1778 and 18 at her Kiddushin in 1782\n\n               a.Rabbi Mordechai Torczyner (Rabbi at Congregation Sons of Israel...Allentown) and his wife Caren did the scholarly interpretation. He is quizzical as to why in the dedication starts with the blessing  to a married woman but gives the blessing  of Chupah and good deeds _�_ standard blessings for Jewish women.\n\ni.\tHe speculates_�_- If she isn't yet married then why is she the wife of the distinguished man? And if she is married then why bless her for Chupah? One possible speculation - Jewish marriage consists of two stages, Kiddushin and Nisuin. Kiddushin is the giving of the ring, and begins the marital bond, but the marital bond is not complete until Nisuin, which is the stage under the Chupah. A man and woman who have executed Kiddushin but not Nisuin are considered married - if they wish to separate, they need a religious bill of divorce. Historically, Jews conducted Kiddushin, then wait up to a year while the groom arranged his livelihood, then conclude Nisuin - and this could have been a wedding gift for Kiddushin. \n\n\n\n                            1.If this is correct it could very well have been a wedding gift to Reyna (Rachael) Simon at her Kiddushin (1782).\n\n\n\n\n5.The strong evidence as to the author still points  to Abraham Eleazer Cohen given the signature\n\n6.\tGiven the later date on the Penn.

IN A LETTER TO A REVEREND HIGH PRIEST OF THE CHURCH BY LAW ESTABLISHED. THE SECOND EDITION. BY SOLOMON ABRABANEL, OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID. London: Printed for J. Webb. 1736. \n\n\n\nThe second of at least eight 1736 printings. \n\n\n\nPamphlet on discrimination against Jews in England \n\n\n\nThe title page to this disbound and very scarce pamphlet reads, _��The Complaint of the Children of Israel, Representing their Grievances under the Penal Laws; and Praying, That if the Tests are Repealed, the Jews may have the Benefit of this Indulgence in common with all other Subjects of England. In a Letter to a Reverend High Priest of the Church by Law Established. \n\n\n\nThe author of this work, writing under the pseudonym of Solomon Abrabanel, was actually not Jewish at all, but a professional political writer. William Arnall, who died the same year that this pamphlet was published, had authored many political pamphlets in the service of Robert Walpole, England_��s first prime minister (though he did not carry that title). Arnall also wrote under the pseudonym of Francis Walsingham. \n\n\n\nAnti-semitism was endemic in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and many dispossessed Jews followed William the Conqueror into England in 1066. Slowly they fell victim to the same discrimination that they had found elsewhere. Taxation was one such burden: though the Jews constituted less than 0.25 percent of the English population, they contributed 8 percent of the entire income to the king_��s treasury, due to high taxation rates on their property. Though they were a valuable asset to the English crown, by the middle of the 13th century the Jews were no longer allowed to own land or to inherit their parents_�� money; all Jewish assets passed to the government once the owner died. In 1290 the Jews were formally expelled from England, and most fled to France and Spain. Some remained in Britain, hiding their identity and religion. For the next three and a half centuries, there were virtually no practicing Jews in England. \n\n\n\nThe pamphlet summarizes their history thus, quoting from Camden, the great English historian: \n\n\n\nThe Jews flourished mightily in London a little after the Conquest; being encouraged particularly by William Rufus. But their Wealth, says his Lordship in succeeding Times did them great Injury, when they were miserably tortured by King John to discover and deliver up their hidden Treasures. In the 11th of Edward the First, their Synagogues were all pluck_��d down; and in the 16th Year of that King they were all banished to the Number of Fifteen Thousand; but their Riches were all to be left behind, and they were not allowed to take any Money or Goods along with them, save only for the necessary Charges of their Transportation. \n\n\n\nThe pamphlet also quotes extensively from the antiquarian Stowe_��s account of the horrors inflicted on the Jews during the reigns of King John and Edward I. \n\n\n\nThen, under Cromwell and the Glorious Revolution, the door to England opened again. Due to the negotiations of Manasseh Ben Israel and others with Cromwell, Jews were allowed back in England in 1655. With the _��age of enlightenment,_�� the official restrictions against Jews were relaxed, and by 1723 they were allowed once again to hold lands. In fact, legislation passed in that year exempted them from having to include the words _��on the true faith of a Christian_�� in the Oath of Abjuration that was required of all landowners, and this is the first piece of legislation in England that describes Jews as English subjects. \n\n\n\nThis was the climate in which Arnall_��s pamphlet was written, and it was so popular that it went through at least six editions in 1736. Though Arnall was not a Jew, it is probable that many Jews in England saw their situation just as Arnall described it. English law was not supposed to discriminate against its citizens on the basis of religious affiliation alone since the settlement made with Cromwell, thanks to the proliferation of sects and denominations (often known as _��Dissenters_��) in England at that time. \n\n\n\nThe pamphlet argues, \n\n\n\nYou, Sir, who are an Orthodox High Priest, will judge between us Jews and the Dissenters, whether we have not the same Right as the best of them to Employments? Or, what Pretence there can be, that against the Constitution of the Country in which we live, We, of all other People, should have no share in enacting or executing the Laws which we are bound to obey? Why might not the Land of Canaan be as profitably represented in Parliament as the Kingdom of Sc___nd, and with as little Prejudice to the Church of England, from our Synagogue, as from their Kirk? \n\n\n\nHe continues, \n\n\n\nI could, Sir, give you many Reasons to convince you, that natural Christian Policy should induce you to favour us Jews; that you have many Obligations to us as a Clergyman, though you forget all Relation to us as a Christian; that as our Religion was the Parent of yours, our Synagogue is the Buttress of the Christian Church, an Evidence of its Extraction, an Authority to prove its Antiquity, a living Record to testify whence you had your Revelation; and that therefore you cannot be too indulgent to a People, whose Establishment cannot be destroyed without removing the Foundation of your own. \n\n\n\nArnall goes on to discuss the issue of the divine right of tithes, serving in parish offices, and other legal restrictions, concluding, \n\n\n\nAs it is but Fourscore Years since our Re-admission, our Fathers, for the most Part, were Aliens by Birth, and could not claim a natural Right to the Privileges of the Community. They could only be receiv_��d as Foreigners, with proper Encouragement to trust their Families and Effects under the Publick Protection. But in this Course of Time the Jews of Cromwell_��s Days are dead, and we their Children are natural-born Subjects of Britain; so that what Incapacity or Disability may remain upon us, is entirely to be laid to the Charge of Religion, and is an Hardship upon us for dissenting from the National Establishment. This is our Grievance, and this we hope will at length have Redress; that the War which hath been carry_��d on against us almost ever since the Norman Conquest, may now be brought to a Conclusion, and that we may not be oppress_��d any longer for no other Reason, than that after the Way which Men call Heresy we worship the God of our Fathers. \n\n\n\nArnall argues eloquently in this 40-page pamphlet that freedom of religion should not be extended simply to the Protestant Dissenters but to people of all faiths, particularly to those who had suffered so much, to England_��s financial benefit. \n\n\n\nDisbound, this pamphlet is in pristine condition, with no soiling, wrinkling, or tears. Paper is crisp and clean, with very little age-toning. All pages are present and tightly bound. No owner_��s or library marks. \n\n\n\nIt measures about 5 x 7.5 and has 39 pages.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{21E86563-0879-48CA-8841-090EFEFC9C84}","objects_refno":"2008.01.27.00001","objects_customfield_6":"OCLC 12248121 [6].","objects_customfield_5":"ABRABANEL,  SOLOMON","objects_objtype":"JEWISH SUBJECT MATTER","objects_date":"1/1/1736","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"The complaint of the children of Israel, representing their grievances under the penal laws; and praying, that if the tests are repealed, the jews may have the benefit of this indulgence in common with all other subjects of England.

Their chief financier, Sampson Gideon, had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London. Possibly as a reward, Henry Pelham in 1753 brought in the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalized by application to Parliament. It passed the Lords without much opposition, but on being brought down to the House of Commons, the Tories made a great outcry against this abandonment of Christianity, as they called it.

His father, John de Faria, was born in St. Giles, Belgium. The information de Faria provides lent credence to canard of the so called Popish Plot, a supposed criminal Catholic endeavor to overturn the Protestant government of England. We learn from his testimony that de Faria was recruited as an agent in Antwerp, where he made the acquaintance of several English Catholics, who convinced him to travel to London where he became personal assistant to the Portuguese ambassador. Along with his brother Abraham, Francisco de Faria was subsequently hired by the Portuguese as an assassin. A tale of considerable intrigue and suspense. See AJHSP, Volume XX, pages 115-132 Cf.

This early newsbook / newspaper was printed in London, England and consists of approximately 110 pages, the dimensions of which are 8.5 x 6.5. It was published by Abel Boyer. \n\n\n\nThis newsbook was issued monthly and each issue has the date of publication on the front page. The news coverage has mostly to do with the various countries of Europe in general and the Royalty of Europe in particular. There is coverage of the American Colonies in some issues. There is lots of coverage of WARS, treaties, important people, commerce, deaths, disasters, Kings, Queens, i.e.- all the news that one sees in today's newspapers.\n\n\n\nThis issue contains 5 pages of news from the Catholic INQUISITION in PORTUGAL and has many names of the people who were persecuted under the PORTUGESE INQUISITION, most of whom were prosecuted for being JEWISH. This long and detailed report contains the names of many Jews and what their punishment was for a specific crime.\n\nAbel Boyer (1667- 1729) was a French-English lexicographer, journalist and miscellaneous writer. He had started publishing a monthly periodical, The Political State of Great Britain, being an impartial account of the most material occurrences, ecclesiastical, civil, and military, in a monthly letter to a friend in Holland (1711-29). Its contents, which were those of a monthly newspaper, included abstracts of the chief political pamphlets published on both sides, and is both from its form and matter, very useful for reference. The Political State is, moreover, particularly noticeable as being the first periodical, issued at brief intervals, which contained a parliamentary chronicle, and in which parliamentary debates were reported with comparative regularity and with some approximation to accuracy. In the case of the House of Lords' reports various devices, such as giving only the initials of the names of the speakers, were resorted to in order to escape punishment, but in the case of the House of Commons the entire names were frequently given. According to Boyer's own account he had been furnished by members of both houses of parliament (among whom he mentioned Lord Stanhope) with reports of their speeches, and he had even succeeded in becoming an occasional 'ear-witness' of the debates themselves. When he was threatened at the beginning of 1729 with arrest by the printers of the votes, whose monopoly they accused him of infringing, he asserted that for thirty years in his Political State, he had given reports of parliamentary debates without being molested. The threat induced him to discontinue the publication of the debates. He intended to resume the work, but failed to carry out his intention. He died in a house which he had built for himself at Chelsea.     \n\n","thing_uuid":"{EB26C7A8-CC58-45AC-9ECA-9CE3B83274ED}","objects_refno":"2009.12.02.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2009.12.02.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Numerous Jews listed","objects_objtype":"The Political State of Great Britain","objects_date":"12/1/1729","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Complete early 1729 newsbook titled \"\"The Political State of Great Britain\"\" published by Abel Boyer containting coverage of the American colonies and the Catholic Inquisition in Portugal and reports Jews persecuted","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Numerous","location":"London, England","date":null,"container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"International","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"35","tiff_locat":"doc_in_35_1r.tif; doc_in_35_1v.tif; doc_in_35_2r.tif; doc_in_35_2v.tif; doc_in_35_3r.tif; doc_in_35_3v.tif; doc_in_35_4r.tif; doc_in_35_4v.tif; doc_in_35_5r.tif; doc_in_35_5v.tif; doc_in_35_6r.tif; doc_in_35_6v.tif; doc_in_35_7r.tif; doc_in_35_7v.tif; do","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.759408,38.254239]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":769,"longitude":-85.75940845,"latitude":38.2542387,"ref_1":"ref4331","ref_2":"cid4637743","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Pamphlets","descriptio":"Pamphlet (Judaica) - Oration Delivered on the Fifth Anniversary of The Home for Jewish Widows and Orphans.

The discourses are based on Isaiah xlii. 6, 7 and Leviticus xxxix. 43. Cyrus Adler and Frank H. Vizetelly note in the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia that during Gottheil's time in Manchester, Two of his most noteworthy sermons preached in Manchester were on the slavery question, attacking those who had declared the institution to be sanctioned by Mosaic Law. He joined Temple Emanu-El of NYC in 1873 as Co-Rabbi to the aging Samuel Adler.\n\n\n\nThere are only three copies of this sermon in American libraries.\n\n\n\nIn 1860 Rabbi Gustav Gottheil (1827-1903) received a call from the Reform Jews of Manchester, England; he went there as rabbi for the Manchester Congregation of British Jews and remained for 13 years. During this time he was connected with the faculty of Owens College as a teacher of the German language. Two of his most noteworthy sermons preached in Manchester were on the slavery question, attacking those who had declared the institution to be sanctioned by Mosaic Law. Dr. Gottheil was a member of the Synod of Leipzig in 1871, which took a decided stand on the question of Reform. He left Manchester in 1873, having been elected to succeed the Rev. J. K. Gutheim as assistant to Dr. Samuel Adler, the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, New York. When Adler retired about eighteen months later, Gottheil succeeded him. On taking charge he reorganized the religious school, and assisted in founding a theological school where preliminary training might be imparted to future candidates for the rabbinate. He prepared in 1886 the first Jewish hymn-book printed in America (with music in a separate volume by A. Davis); it contains not only traditional Jewish hymns, but also others of Christian origin, and upon it was based the Union Hymnal, which has since been generally adopted by the Reform congregations in the United States. In 1889 he started the first Sisterhood of Personal Service, a philanthropic organization affiliated with Temple Emanu-El which served as a model for similar institutions elsewhere. Dr. Gottheil was the founder of the Association of Eastern Rabbis, and when it was assimilated with the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1890, he took an active part in its deliberations. He was one of the founders and the president of the (American) Jewish Publication Society, vice-president of the Federation of American Zionists, chairman of the Revision Committee for the Union Prayer Book, and one of the governors of the Hebrew Union College, in Cincinnati.\n\n\n\nDr. Gottheil's sympathies and interests were broadly Universalist, as evidenced by his connection with various non-Jewish institutions as well as by many of his sermons and writings. He was one of the founders of the New York State Conference of Religions, assisting in the editing of its Book of Common Prayers; and a founder and for many years vice-president of the Nineteenth Century Club. In 1893 Gottheil was one of the representatives of the Jews at the Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago during the World Columbian Exposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most Reform Jews of the time, Rabbi Gottheil was a supporter of Zionism and attended the First Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland. He was the most prominent American Jew to respond to Theodor Herzl's call and served as vice-president of the newly created Federation of American Zionists, a forerunner of the Zionist Organization of America. Rabbi Gottheil's belief was an act of faith, but it brought condemnation and vilification upon him from both the American Reform community and the American Orthodox community. American Reform Judaism viewed the struggling birth of Zionism as a betrayal of loyalty to America; Zionism, they said, was unstable, and it tasted bitterly of the dangerous, ancient Anti-Semitic accusations of dual loyalty. It threatened the position of the Jews in the new Zion of America. American Orthodox Judaism equally reviled the infant Zionist movement. Zionism, they felt, was a betrayal of faith in God's ultimate promise of redemption. To the Orthodox, it denied the coming of the Messiah.\n\n\n\nHe had a major influence on Reform Judaism in the United States. He was the founder of several Jewish societies and a governor of the Cincinnati Hebrew Union College. In 1886 he prepared the first American Jewish hymnbook, much of which was incorporated in the Union Hymnal adopted by most of the American Reform congregations. Gottheil was the most prominent American rabbi at the first World Zionist Congress (1897), and he became one of the founders of the Federation of American Zionists, later the Zionist Organization of America. Columbia University founded the Gustav Gottheil lectureship in Semitic languages in his honor.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{E3541D08-2B10-4F55-B2D8-A99BD32B424C}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01217","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.01217","objects_customfield_5":"Gottheil, Gustav  (1827.1903)","objects_objtype":"MOSES VERSUS SLAVERY: BEING TWO DISCOURS","objects_date":"1/1/1861","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"This rare anti slavery sermon by Rabbi Gustav Gottheil delivered in England.

Andrews, a former resident of Charleston, S. C., and Philadelphia. In 1847, when his brother died, he donated several acres of land to the Israelites of Memphis to be used as a burial-ground. This caused his resident coreligionists to organize in 1850 a Hebrew Benevolent Society. Divine service was then held only on Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom ha-Kippurim. \n\nBy 1853 there was a considerable increase in the Jewish population, and a congregation was organized under the name B'nai Israel, with M. Simonas president and Solomon Hess as secretary. A hall was leased in a building on Front street; and Jonas Levy, formerly of Little Rock, Ark., was engaged as ?azzan and sho?e?. A Hebrew school, under the direction of the Rev. L. Sternheimer, was established, and a lot was bought with $2,000 donated by Judah Touro in 1853. \n\nIn 1935, the Jewish community of Memphis, Tennessee, established the Jewish Welfare Board which had roots in the Hebrew Benevolent Society dating back to 1850. Founded as a communal fundraising body, the Fund's mandate was expanded in 1977, at which time the name was changed to Memphis Jewish Federation.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{38AF17BC-FA01-406B-AFE0-87122B82F3AD}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01236","objects_customfield_6":"SINGERMAN #1198...ONLY ONE OTHER COPY located","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / NUMEROUS JEWS","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/1/1851","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"The constitution and bylaws of the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Memphis, Tennessee, instituted September 1st, 1850.

It is the first time in America that a Religious leader deals with the laws of Kashrut and then places them in a contemporary context. There is no evidence that a Part 2 was ever published.\n\n\n\nAlexander Abraham de Sola (September 18, 1825..London - June 5, 1882��_NYC) was a Canadian Rabbi, author, Orientalist, and scientist. Originating from a large renown family of Rabbis and scholars, De Sola was recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodox Judaism in the United States during the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\nIn 1846, De Sola was elected minister of the Shearith Israel congregation of Montreal, Canada, and he arrived in that city early in 1847. In 1848, De Sola was appointed lecturer, and in 1853 professor, of Hebrew and Oriental literature at McGill University, Montreal, and he eventually became the senior professor of its faculty of arts. He was president of the Natural History Society for several years, and addressed its members frequently on those branches of scientific investigation which came within its province. The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him in 1858 by McGill University. This was the first instance of a Jew attaining that honor in an English-speaking country.\n\n\n\nIn 1873, by invitation of President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, De Sola opened the United States Congress with prayer. The event was of significance, as De Sola was a British subject, and this was the first indication of a more friendly feeling between the United States and Great Britain after the dangerously strained relations that had been caused by the recently adjusted Alabama Claims. Mr. Gladstone, then premier, as well as Sir Edward Thornton, the British ambassador at Washington, extended the thanks of the British government to De Sola.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham de Sola frequently visited the United States, and, through his pulpit addresses and numerous contributions to the press, became recognized there as one of the most powerful leaders of Orthodoxy, at a time when the struggle between the Orthodox and Reform wings of the community was at an acute stage. He was intimately associated with Isaac Leeser, Samuel Myer Isaacs, Bernhard Illowy, J. J. Lyons, and other upholders of Jewish tradition, and on the death of Isaac Leeser was invited to become successor to his pulpit; but this and many similar offers he declined. For twenty years he was a constant contributor to Leeser's Occident, and after the latter's death he purchased the copyrights and stereotype plates of his works and continued their publication. He died in New York City in 1882 and was buried in Montreal.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CDCEFFF9-3787-45EC-BE87-ABC033DCB6AB}","objects_refno":"2011.07.19.00001","objects_customfield_6":"WorldCat locates one copy in Canada and Singerman locates no copies","objects_customfield_5":"DE SOLA, ABRAHAM","objects_objtype":"Sanatory Institutions of the Hebrews:","objects_date":"1/1/1861","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"The sanatory institutions of the Hebrews: as exhibited in the scriptures and Rabbinical writings, and as bearing upon modern sanatory regulations.

Neither the American Jewish Archives nor the American Jewish Historical Society posses a copy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristically, American Jews chose not to unite and dispatch one letter to congratulate Washington on his inauguration. Instead three different letters where sent. The congregation in Newport, Rhode Island sent its own letter as noted above.\n\n\n\nThe most important of the letters came in the correspondence of the Jews of Newport. They declined to sign the letters sent by the other congregations. This may have been because the citizenry of Rhode Island were divided on whether or not to join the new union and the state's Jews may have been hesitant to make a public statement on the matter by writing to the newly elected president. Nonetheless, when the Washington visited Newport in 1790, Moses Seixas, the warden of the congregation, addressed him on its behalf. Washington replied: For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support . . . May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants. \n\n\n\nDuring the struggle for the passage of the Maryland Jew Bill (to eliminate Jewish disabilities in the state) at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one supporter, Col. William G.D. Worthington, delivered an address before state legislature and read the entire correspondence between the Jews of Newport and Washington, and he cited from the exchanges with the other communities. The letters continued to be cited by Jews and their advocates throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to demonstrate that the Founding Father had sanctioned their inclusion in the American nation. The letter to Newport Jewry continues to be read in a public ceremony hosted annually by the city's Touro Synagogue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communities of Philadelphia, New York, Charleston and Richmond sent one jointly. In response to the good wished expressed in the latter letter, Washington reciprocated: May the same temporal and eternal blessings which you implore for me, rest upon your Congregations. While the Jews of Savannah sent a third letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1797 a book was published with the official correspondence of President George Washington.

The New York Times for July 30, 1870, reported it, calling Nathan one of the most prominent, wealthy, public-spirited and best beloved of our Jewish citizens. Nathan's father Samuel had helped to found the New York Stock Exchange, of which Benjamin was a member. Judge Cardozo was a brother-in-law. Benjamin was a founder of Mount Sinai Hospital, and had served as its president. The murder was front-page news in New York, exceeding even the Franco-Prussian War in public interest. Nathan's murder was never solved; no one named Anson Bunker was a suspect. \n\n\n\nThis lurid pamphlet chronicles Bunker's other murders, all demonstrating his boldness, brutality, and cunning, without a parallel in the history of crime. These occurred in New York, in Canada during its Rebellion, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, New Orleans, and elsewhere. Bunker's adventures in the Confederate Army during the Civil War are also described. In fact, wherever the action was, Bunker could be found, murdering and pillaging. \n\n\n\nMajor General Francis Preston Blair Jr. was a witness to members of the family of Benjamin Nathan running out of their home for help when they found Mr. Nathan murdered. The Nathan home was on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. General Blair was in bed in a hotel across the street, and awaken by the cries of the Nathan family members. Blair had been the running mate to former New York Governor Horatio Seymour when they ran for President and Vice President against Ulysses Grant and Schuyler Colfax in 1868.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{92FD6383-B2D6-42AF-B0EA-60EA59B9C1B7}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00993","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.00993","objects_customfield_5":"NATHAN, BENJAMIN","objects_objtype":"A GREAT NUMBER OF MYSTERIOUS MURDERS ...","objects_date":"1/1/1880","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Jews are listed","descript_1":"Pamphlet that chronicles \"\"The Bloody Hand\"\" Anson Bunker's murders","person_nam":"Nathan, Benjamin","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Nathan, Benjamin","location":"New York, NY","date":"1880-01-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"","container1":"","containe_1":"","containe_2":"","containe_3":"","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_nyc_953_1r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_1v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_2r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_2v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_3r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_3v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_4r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_4v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_5r.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_5v.tif; doc_ja_nyc_953_6r.tif; d","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1509,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref4190","ref_2":"","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Books","descriptio":"THE CHALLENGE ACCEPTED; A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A JEW AND A CHRISTIAN: THE FORMER ANSWERING A CHALLENGE THROWN OUT BY THE LATTER, RESPECTING THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROPHECIES PREDICTIVE OF THE ADVENT OF JESUS\n\n\n\nNew York: Printed for the author, and sold by Isaacs & Solomons, 1850. \n\n\n\nSelig Newman was a German Hebraist; he was educated at Posen, but in 1814 went to England and was appointed minister to the Plymouth congregation, teaching Hebrew at the same time at the University of Oxford.

The sermon was widely reprinted, drawing praise throughout the South and criticism from Jewish and non-Jewish abolitionists in the North (EJ).

He was considered the most prominent Jew in Missouri during the 19th century. One of the prominent characters in St. Louis during the Civil War was Isidor Busch, a wine-merchant. He was one of the delegates on the Unconditional Union Ticket to a convention which decided that Missouri should remain in the Union.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 15 he became involved in the printing business and began the study of foreign languages. He soon became part owner of Schmid & Bush, which became one of Vienna's largest publishers. When the Revolution of 1848 failed he had to flee to New York, where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849 and opened a small stationery and bookstore in New York. His weekly journal Israel's Herold failed after only three months.\n\n\n\nHe moved to St. Louis the same year, where he opened a general store while continuing to write articles for various journals. He was the founder of B'Ne-El in 1853.  In 1870 he organized the firm of Isidor Bush & Company, which became one of the most successful wine and liquor enterprises in St. Louis. He also became the general passenger agent and auditor for the St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railroad Company and served as president of Peoples' Savings Bank in St. Louis. Bush was closely associated with B'nai B'rith and helped to develop the B'nai B'rith Cleveland Orphans Home as well as developing several national insurance and endowment programs for the organization. \n\n\n\nBush served as secretary to General John Fremont during the Civil War and also served on the St. Louis Board of Education and the City Council. He attended several state conventions during the Civil War period as a delegate from St. Louis and was a strong opponent to slavery.\n\n\n\nLater in life Bush became interested in viticulture. He purchased a tract of land (named by him Bushberg) outside the city, which became noted for its products. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, The Bushberg Catalogue, which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{3C7C3096-0665-4DE3-A4CB-9D016E20F2BB}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01234","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.01234","objects_customfield_5":"BUSH, ISIDOR / (1822.1898) also Busch","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/1/1849","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"Catalogue of hebrew works published in Vienna for sale at I.

M. Peixotto_�_1830_ѝ\n\n\n\nSingerman # 500\n\n\n\nDr. Daniel Levy Maduro Peixotto (1800-1843) was born in Amsterdam on July 18, 1800. He graduated from Columbia College at the age of sixteen and earned the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1819. Later, in 1825, he earned an M.A. from Columbia. Peixotto married Rachel Seixas, [the daughter of Benjamin Seixas], in 1823. They had 8 children: Judith, Zipporah, Sarah, Moses Levy Maduro II, Rebecca, Benjamin Franklin, Raphael, and Miriam.\n\n\n\n In 1822 he published the article Observations on the Climate and Diseases of the Island of Curacao in The New York Medical and Physical Journal, the first ever English-language regular quarterly medical journal. He eventually became one of its editors and was a frequent contributor to other periodicals and newspapers of the day.      Among the many offices he held were secretary of the Academy of Medicine (1825); physician to the City Dispensary (1827); and president of the New York Medical Society (1830-32); he was also one of the organizers of the Society for Assisting the Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. Having accepted the appointment of president of the Willoughby Medical College, he removed to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was dean of the faculty for a number of years. Returning to New York [in 1841], he resumed his practice there, and continued it until his death [from consumption at the age of 43]. \n\n\n\nHe possessed a broad and deep religious nature and was a firm believer in the Jewish faith as is evidenced by an address delivered by him before the Society for the Education of Orphan Children and the Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion while he was vice-president of the Medical Society of the City and County of New York. During the course of his address he said:_�_ _��The writings of the Hebrews are generally acknowledged to be unequaled for the simplicity and dignity - the strength, conciseness and boldness of their style; the perfect truth to nature of their imagery; their animated eloquence and sublime figures. The conceits and puerile vanities which disgrace much of classical literature are altogether banished from their pages. It may, however, be suggested that these writings were inspired. This assertion is more imposing by its speciousness than forcible by its application. The great truths and sublime doctrines which were inculcated by Moses and the Prophets were undoubtedly derived from immediate communication with the Almighty._ѝ\n\n","thing_uuid":"{25B63565-AF2C-4B53-A7CE-F4C625C58F94}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01227","objects_customfield_6":"ASWR # 324 / Singerman #500","objects_customfield_5":"Peixotto, DANIEL L.M.","objects_objtype":"Pamphlet","objects_date":"1/1/1830","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Jewish Author","descript_1":"Pamphlet of Anniversary Discourse before the Society for the Education of Orphan Children, and the Relief of Indigent Persons of the Jewish Persuasion by Dr. Daniel L.

J. Roberts for the assault & battery on Noah. Incredible detail of this well publicized event. A New York-American reporter was a witness.\n\n\n\nOn the back page is a small notice on the election of the officers of the Medical Society of NYC. Peixotto was elected as a censor\n\n\nMordecai Manuel Noah (July 14, 1785, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania _�� May 22, 1851, New York) was an American playwright, diplomat, journalist, and utopian. He was the most important Jewish lay leader in New York in the pre-Civil War period, and the first Jew born in the United States to reach national prominence.\n\n\n\nIn 1811, he was appointed by President James Madison as consul at Riga, then part of Imperial Russia, but declined, and, in 1813, was nominated Consul to the Kingdom of Tunis, where he rescued American citizens kept as slaves by Moroccan masters. In 1815, Noah received a stunning blow in the words of US Secretary of State James Monroe, his religion was an obstacle to the exercise of [his] Consular function. The incident caused outrage among Jews and non-Jews alike. Noah moved to New York, where he founded and edited The National Advertiser, The New York Enquirer (later merged into The Courier and Enquirer), The Evening Star, and The Sunday Times newspapers. In 1819, Noah's most successful play, She Would Be a Soldier, was produced\n\n\n\nDuring his travels to Europe and the Barbary Coast, the sight of Jews' oppressed conditions had left a profound impression on Noah, and he became focused on the need for Jewish emigration to more hospitable shores. In a precursor to modern Zionism, journalist and utopian Mordecai Manuel Noah tried to found a Jewish homeland at Grand Island in the Niagara River, to be called Ararat, after Mount Ararat, the Biblical resting place of Noah's Ark.\n\n\n\nIn 1825 he helped purchase a 2,500-acre tract of land on Grand Island in the Niagara River near Buffalo. Here he envisioned a Jewish colony to be called Ararat, which would be a temporary haven where Jews from persecuted countries could safely await restoration to their ancient Holy Land. The project, undertaken in Noah's typical highly-publicized style, elicited much interest and discussion, but ultimately was a failure_�_ He had brought with him a cornerstone which read Ararat, a City of Refuge for the Jews, founded by Mordecai M. Noah in the Month of Tishri, 5586 (September, 1825) and in the Fiftieth Year of American Independence. On September 2, soon after arriving in Buffalo from New York, thousands of Christians and a smattering of Jews assembled for a historic event. Noah led a large procession, headed by Masons, a New York militia company, and municipal leaders paraded to St. Paul's Episcopal Church [10]. Here, there was a brief ceremony- including a singing of the psalms in Hebrew- the cornerstone was laid on the communion table, and the new proclamation establishing \n\nthe refuge was read. Proclamation _�� day ended with music, cannonade and libation. 24 guns, recessional, masons retired to the Eagle Tavern, all with no one ever having set foot on Grand Isle. This was the beginning and the end of Mordecai Noah's venture: he lost heart and returned to New York a couple days later without once having set foot on the island.\n\n\n\nAfter the major disappointment of Ararat, Noah regarded Palestine as the only possible homeland for Jews, and frequent lectured and wrote about the subject. His 1844 Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews is one of the most well known works on this topic, in which he expressed ideas that preceded the modern Zionists by more than half a century. In his 1844 Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews Noah proclaimed his faith that the Jews would return and rebuild their ancient homeland and called on America to take the lead in this endeavor.\n\n\n\nFrom 1827-1828, Noah led New York City's Tammany Hall political machine.He was a staunch supporter of slavery. He worried that emancipation would threaten the whole country's safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{D6F8036A-9DCA-4DB3-8A2F-F2FB5F192B3C}","objects_refno":"2007.07.28.00004","objects_customfield_6":"See LOC broadside & write-up under comparision object","objects_customfield_5":"NOAH, MORDECAI MANUEL  (1785.1851) / Peixotto, D.

The box score listing Boaz was published in the NEW YORK CLIPPER on 12/5/1857. While Lip was the first Jewish professional baseball player, his older brother Boaz was the first listed Jewish player to participate in the early beginnings of serious amateur baseball that would then move into the paid arena. This paper is the earliest know report.\n\n\n\nLists Boaz Pike, he was born in New York, New York, USA on 27 Aug 1842 to Emanuel B Pike and Jane Lyons. He passed away on 1912 in New York, New York, USA. His brother was Lipman Emanuel Lip Pike (May 25, 1845 - October 10, 1893) the Iron Batter, was one of the stars of 19th century baseball in the United States. He was the first player to be revealed as a professional (meaning he was paid money to play), as well as the first Jewish player. His brother, Jay Pike, played briefly for the Hartford Dark Blues during the 1877 season. His family was of Dutch background who moved to Brooklyn, New York when he was young, and his father was a haberdasher. \n\n\n\nLipman Emanuel Lip Pike (May 25, 1845-Oct. 10, 1893), the Iron Batter, was one of the stars of 19th Century Baseball in the United States.  He was the first to be revealed as a professional (meaning he was paid money to play), as well as his brother Boaz,  who played for the Hartford Dark Blues during the 1877 season.  By the 1860s, Boaz and Lipman were playing for the Atlantics, one of the most illustrious clubs in a city full of great baseball clubs: Boaz was a hard-hitting infielder and outfielder.  Boaz was the first of the Pike Brothers to play baseball, just one week after his Bar Mitzvah, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIKE BROTHER'S PLAYED THERE.; L. PIKE PLAYED LEFT FIELD FOR THE NATIONALS AND IS THE FIRST KNOWN; JEWISH PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER ALL OF THE BROTHERS PLAYED.\n\n\n\nA somewhat mythological Brooklyn ballplayer, Boaz Pike, was said by the old Brooklyn Eagle to have struck the longest ball yet battled on the field, not less, perhaps, than 600 feet straight ahead. \n\n\n\nNote:  Lipman E. Lip Pike became baseball's first professional player when the Philadelphia Athletics recognized his talent in 1866.  The team gave him $20 a week to play third base.  Pike was soon followed by others.  The baseball players of the time were professional and amateurs.  \n\n\n\nLip Pike \n\nby Robert H. Schaefer \n\n \n\nBorn May 25, 1845, Lipman Emanuel Pike was the first great Jewish baseball player, playing professionally from 1866 to 1881. While no comparable statistical records exist for his career through 1870, from 1871 through 1881 Pike appeared in 425 National Association and National League games, hitting .321 with a slugging average of .463. Despite being small by modern standards...(5'8, 158 lbs.),1 Pike nonetheless was among the premier sluggers of his time.\n\n\n\nThe son of a haberdasher2, Pike, according to the Big Book of Jewish Baseball, \n\n\n\n...[W]as born in New York City. He was the son of Emanuel and Jane Pike. The Pike family were Jews of Dutch origin. Lip had an older brother, Boaz, two younger brothers, Israel and Jacob, and a sister, Julia. The Pike family moved to Brooklyn when Lipman was very young. \n\n\n\nBoaz was the first of the Pike brothers to play base ball. Just one week after his bar mitzvah, Lip appeared in his first recorded game, along with Boaz. This was an amateur game.3\n\n\n\nPlaying for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1866, for whom the long ball was a prominent part of [their] arsenal, Pike had numerous multi-homer games on a team that boasted several sluggers capable of smashing the ball beyond the reach of opposing fielders.4 A description in The Baseball Chronology of the events of July 16, 1866, gives an indication both of Pike's home run prowess and of the nature of the game at the time:\n\n\n\nLipman Pike of the Athletics of Philadelphia hits six [6] home runs, five in succession, against the Alert club of Philadelphia. Final score is 67-25.5\n\n\n\nAlso in 1866, Pike played a major role in the professionalizing of the game as Philadelphia City Item publisher Fitzgerald...charged the club with paying two or possibly three members of the first nine (reportedly Dockney, McBride and Pike) $20 per week.6 Meanwhile, The Biographical History of Baseball reports:\n\n\n\nPike was one of the first players to be acknowledged as a professional. While others had certainly been paid before 1866, Pike, along with two teammates on the ostensibly amateur Philadelphia Athletics, was ordered to appear before the judiciary committee of the governing National Association of Base Ball Players to answer charges that he had accepted $20 for his services. Although the matter was dropped when nobody bothered to show up for the hearing, the incident exposed for the first time the wide spread practice of paying supposedly amateur players.7 \n\n\n\nThis was perhaps the first step in legitimizing the practice of play for pay. By 1869 acceptance of this idea allowed all-professional teams to be admitted to the Association. However, the professional teams proved to be so far superior to the amateur teams that matches between them were laughable. This led to the formation of the first all-professional league in 1871. This, in turn, sounded the death knell for organized amateur baseball and its governing body, The National Association of Base Ball Players.\n\n\n\nOverall, Pike seems to have had a fine season with the outstanding Philadelphia Athletic club of 1866, appearing in sixteen of twenty-five games for a team that went 23-2. Playing the outfield as well as second and third base, Pike, in the rudimentary statistics of the day, made an average of 2.7 outs per game while scoring 6.4 runs per game.8 \n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the1866 season, dissatisfaction with non-native professional players became a major issue with the Philadelphia club, leading to Pike's dismissal from the team: \n\n\n\nThe two salaried players who had been imported from New York (Dockney and Pike) were jettisoned in favor of Philadelphians. This experiment had never worked the way management had hoped. Whenever the play of the Athletics had been considered suspicious, the two 'foreigners' had been the most suspected. It seemed that, as nonnatives [sic], their loyalty was perpetually in question. With the exception of Reach, all of the 1867 regulars were local boys.9 \n\n\n\nIn 1867, Pike played for the well-respected and powerful Irvingtons of New Jersey, (in 6 of the Irvingtons' 23 games, all at third base) and for the first rate Mutuals of New York (in 21 of the Mutuals' thirty games, in the outfield, first, second, and third base). He appeared exclusively for the New York Mutuals in 1868, hitting a robust .497, with a .661 slugging average for a Mutuals team that went 31-10.10\n\n\n\nPike returned to his native Brooklyn in 1869 where he played for one of the nation's leading teams, the Brooklyn Atlantics. For the first time the National Association of Base Ball Players recognized the professional class of player and team. Overall, against all comers, the Atlantics racked up 40 wins against six losses, with two ties. However, the Atlantics record against teams composed exclusively of professionals fell off to 15 wins, six losses, and one tie. This was Pike's first season as a full time player, as he appeared in all 48 games, hitting .610 with an astonishing slugging average of .883. Without diminishing Pike's performance, the modern reader is reminded that in 1869 the batter called for his pitch, telling the pitcher his preference for either a high or low ball, and foul balls did not count as strikes. In addition, the pitcher tossed the ball up to the batter in an under hand motion without snapping his wrist. In other words, the batter did not have to contend with either blazing fastballs or any sort of curve balls. The game was very similar to today's slow pitch softball.\n\n\n\nPike stayed with the Atlantics through the 1870 season, in which the team went 41-17, with 20 wins and 16 losses against professional teams. Pike again played second base in all of the Atlantic games, averaging 2.48 hits and 4.58 total bases per game.11\n\n\n\nWhen the first system of government for professional baseball teams was organized for the 1871 season, The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, Pike joined the entry from Troy, New York, with the New York Clipper announcing that he has been elected captain of the Haymakers of Troy...12 In the nineteenth century the captain was in fact the field manager. He determined who played what position, the batting order, as well as directing play on the diamond, while the manager filled what today would be called the role of the general or business manager.\n\n\n\nThe season got off to an auspicious start for Pike and his nine, as [t]he heavily favored Mutuals [we]re soundly defeated by the Haymakers of Troy, in Brooklyn, 25-10. Lipman Pike, the Troy second baseman, collect[ed] six hits.13\n\n\n\nPike's first year in the newly formed professional league was a smashing success. Playing outfield, first base and second base for a Troy team that finished sixth in a nine-team league, Pike tied for the league lead in home runs (with 4 dingers), placed second in slugging average (.654), third in total bases, fourth in RBIs, and sixth in batting average (.377). However, Pike did not fare too well as captain, turning the helm over to second baseman Bill Carver after three losses in four games.\n\n\n\nLip Pike joined the Baltimore team for the 1872 season. Officially, the team name was The Lord Baltimores but because of their bright yellow shirts with matching caps and hose, they were popularly known as The Canaries. The team owners had vigorously recruited outstanding players during the off-season, and their efforts were rewarded with a second place finish (in an eleven team league). Overall, Pike, playing 56 of his team's 58 games, led the league in home runs (with 6), and RBIs, finishing second in total bases, while hitting a respectable .292.\n\n\n\nContinuing with Baltimore in 1873, Pike hit a fine .315 while again leading the league in home runs with four. As reported in The Baseball Chronology, Pike also found time for an exhibition of his speed on August 16:\n\n\n\nAt Baltimore's Newington Park, Baltimore outfielder Lipman Pike races against a horse named 'Clarence.' Pike has a short lead after 75 yards when the trotter breaks into a run. Pike holds on to win in 10 seconds flat.14\n\n\n\nPrior to the 1874 season, Power hitting Lip Pike, released from his contract with the bankrupt Baltimore organization, signed on as Captain and center fielder for the Hartford Blue Stockings.15 As the Blue Stockings' one bona fide star,16 Pike enjoyed another excellent season, finishing third in hitting at .355, second in on-base percentage and first in slugging (.504).\n\n\n\nFor the 1875 season, Pike signed on with the St. Louis club, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many in Hartford:\n\n\n\nPike, never reticent, offended many in Hartford with his constant boasting of the havoc his new team would wreak on the old.17\n\n\n\nIn 1876, the National League replaced the National Association as the premier organization for professional teams. Indeed, virtually all the old Association teams, at the urging of the League's principal motive force, William Hulbert, simply registered with the new League, leaving the Association an empty shell. It vanished into history without a trace. Pike remained with the new St. Louis NL squad that finished a very respectable second behind the overpowering Chicago White Stockings. Pike batted a solid .323, finished third in slugging (.472), and fifth in total bases. Batting cleanup, then later moving to the leadoff spot, he led his team in every major offensive category, except runs scored and walks. \n\n\n\nPrior to the 1877 season, Pike changed teams yet again, this time signing on as captain with the lackluster Cincinnati Reds. The new fair-foul rule (for 1877) did not hurt the hitting style of...Pike, a four time home run champion in the 1870s,18 but despite leading his league in home runs again, hitting .298, and excel[ling] defensively as a swift center fielder...his heroics were not enough to keep Cincinnati from finishing last in the league for the second consecutive year.19 All that losing seems to have cost Pike the captain's helm, as Pike resign[ed] as Cincinnati Captain (following a 13-2 loss to St. Louis) on June 10, and was succeeded by Bob Addy. Pike continue[d] as the starting center fielder.20\n\n\n\nIt appears that being a left-handed middle infielder finally caught up with Pike in 1877, as David Nemec reports:\n\n\n\nPike played the most games on the [Cincinnati] team at both second base and center field. He moved permanently to center field following a game played in Brooklyn on Aug. 18, 1877. The New York Clipper observed, 'Pike is a splendid outfielder and quick in handling the ball on the bases, but his left-handed throwing unfits him from second-base playing.' 21\n\n\n\nDespite league-leading home run totals that are miniscule compared to the modern era, Pike's status as a true power hitter should not be dismissed. As stated in Before They Were Cardinals, while Pike's totals...were ludicrous by today's standards - he won his four (home run) titles by hitting a combined total of eighteen home runs....As the home run became more commonplace, the game's leading sluggers actually hit a smaller percentage of the overall home runs. In Pike's best season, 1872, his league-leading six home runs accounted for 17.1 percent of the thirty-five home runs hit in the National Association that year. Thus, the 1872 season marked one of only twenty-one occasions in baseball history when a league's leading home run hitter accounted for more than 10 percent of all the league's home runs.22 In addition, he finished in the top ten in slugging and in doubles in seven consecutive seasons, in total bases and triples six times, and OPS five times. All this was accomplished in a career spanning just eight relatively full professional seasons. \n\n\n\nPerhaps his most famous feat of power probably occurred in this season of 1877, as the Sporting Life of May 27, 1883, reflecting on the demolition of Brooklyn's Union Grounds, spoke of the pagoda from which rises the rod once bent by a ball struck from the home plate by 'Lip' Pike.23 How far from home plate was the rod atop the pagoda? The precise dimensions of the Union Grounds were lost forever when it was razed on May 28, 1883. However, the late Larry Zuckerman (a SABR member whose specialty was reconstructing the dimensions of the ball grounds of yesteryear) provided the following information:\n\n\n\nUnion Grounds was between Harrison and Marcy Avenues (sort of east and west) and Rutledge and Lynch Streets (sort of north and south). The field featured a horseshoe shaped grandstand, facing west from Harrison. There was a board fence about 10 feet high surrounding the park, parallel to the streets and about 10 feet inboard of the sidewalks. Assuming a midline location of home plate, the foul lines would have been about 310 feet with dead center about 470 feet..............The pagoda seems to be in right center, more or less on a line drawn from home plate to the Marcy-Rutledge corner. I would put it at about 360 feet from home plate, perhaps more distant...24\n\n\n\nImagine a batted ball crashing into a metal rod about forty feet above the ground level, and 360 feet away from home plate, with sufficient force to bend the rod!!!\n\nZuckerman continues:\n\n\n\nIn 1877 Pike hit the ball over the ladies stand - I have no idea what that means or where it was - but the ball was still in play and he beat it out for an inside the park home run. The paper said it was the longest home run at the park since the introduction of the dead ball, suggesting that it was not as long as some of the 1876 shots...25\n\n\n\nPike re-signed with the Cincinnati nine for the 1878 season. The infamous reserve rule was not enacted until 1879, and the players were free agents once their contract expired at season's end. An account in the May 21, 1878 Redleg Journal gives further evidence of Pike's enormous power:\n\n\n\nLip Pike's long drive highlights a 13-2 win at Lakefront Park in Chicago. Pike's blast not only cleared the fence, but a freight shed and a half dozen railroad cars. Pike only earned a double on this hit, however, because of the ground rules of the ball park. Built on a narrow lot between Michigan Avenue and the railroad yards, Lakefront Park had foul line of less than 200 feet. Balls hit over the fence were considered doubles. Pike's hit was of such force, however, that the Enquirer felt obliged to estimate the distance: 200 yards! No doubt Pike's drive was a mighty wallop, but 600 feet strains credulity.26 \n\n\n\nThe left field line at Lake Front Park was 180 feet, while the right field line measured 196 feet. Straight away center field was about 300 feet. There were two poles located along the outfield fence - one in left center and the other in right center. The ground rule provided that any fly ball clearing the fence between these two poles was an automatic home run. Any other over-the-fence fly balls were merely doubles. Pike must have pulled his ball rather sharply down the right field line.\n\n\n\nCincinnati's acquisition of Buttercup Dickerson spelled the end of Pike's tenure there, as related by David Nemec:\n\n\n\nAfter playing 31 games and hitting .324 in the lead-off position, Lip Pike was released by the Cincinnati team. This is due to Louis 'Buttercup' Dickerson joining the team, even though Pike went 2-for-6 in his last game vs. the Providence Gray's on July 9th. Dickerson batted .309 in 29 games for the Reds. Lip was signed by the Providence team and debuted with them on July 31st. He played second base and batted third. On August 8th, he went 0-for-7, made three errors and was released the next day. Pike was replaced by Charlie Sweasy at second base. Sweasy hit only .175 in 55 games and committed 54 errors so it is difficult to understand how he improved the team.27\n\n\n\nBut Pike got some measure of revenge, as The Baseball Chronology reports the events of July 31, 1878:\n\nLip Pike, released by Cincinnati, goes 4 for 5 with 3 RBIs for Providence, as the Greys beat his old team 9-3.28\n\n\n\nPike slipped down to the minor leagues in 1879 and played for teams in Springfield and Albany. Captain and center fielder for the Springfield club, he appeared in a total of 53 games and hit .356.\n\n\n\nBeginning the 1880 season with Albany, Pike showed he still had home run power, as evidenced by this report in The Baseball Chronology regarding the game of May 21, 1880: \n\n\n\nIn Albany's Riverside Park, Lip Pike hits a ball over the wall and into the river. Right fielder Lon Knight begins to go after the ball in a boat but gives up. Few parks have ground rules about giving the batter an automatic home run on a hit over the fence.29\n\n\n\nAccording to David Nemec:\n\n\n\nPike played for the Albany team until it disbanded in July. He then played for the Unions of Brooklyn in a three-team tournament held at the Union Grounds on August 18th, featuring the Washington and Rochester teams. Pike also played for the New York Metropolitan team. He appeared in a total of 12 games and batted .241.30\n\n\n\nPike opened the [1881] season playing second base for his old Atlantic team in a minor league and working in the mercantile business. However, in late August he was called up by the National League Worchester Ruby Legs when Arthur Irwin was disabled. He joined Worchester on August 27th, played center field and batted second. In six games he went 3-for-25, a mere .120 batting average.31\n\n\n\nPike's miserable play for the Worchester club led to controversy, as noted in The Baseball Chronology's account of events as the season of 1881 drew to a close:\n\n\n\nSeptember 3rd:\n\nCenter fielder Lip Pike makes 3 errors in the 9th inning to give Boston 2 runs and a 3-2 victory over Worchester. The losing club immediately accuses Pike of throwing the game and suspends him.32\n\n\n\nSeptember 29th\n\nAt a National League meeting in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the league adopts a blacklist of players who are barred from playing for or against any NL team until they are removed by the unanimous vote of the league clubs. These men are: Sadie Houck, Lip Pike, Lou Dickerson, Mike Dorgan, Bill Crowley, John Fox, Lew Brown, Emil Gross, and Ed Caskins.33\n\n\n\nHis baseball career essentially over, Pike became a haberdasher in Brooklyn...Lip's haberdashery became a successful business and a meeting place for local base ball enthusiasts. After the expiration of his year's ban, Lip decided to continue with his business enterprise.34\n\n\n\nWhile his professional career was over, Pike continued an interest in the game, playing center field for an amateur club on Long Island.35\n\n\n\nFinally, as reported by David Nemec, Pike made one final attempt to play at the major league level. It came on July 28, 1887:\n\n\n\nAt the age of 42 Pike played center field and batted 6th for the New York Metropolitans, an American Association team. He was supposed to pitch, but switched to the outfield at the last moment. The papers reported that his fielding was good, but 'at the bat he was quite weak.' 36\n\n\n\nPike died of heart disease on October 10, 1893 in Brooklyn, at the age of forty eight. His funeral was a notable event, attended by much of the Jewish and base ball communities of Brooklyn. The services were conducted by Rabbi Geismer of Temple Israel and, according to the Brooklyn Eagle, he 'paid fitting tribute to the exemplary life led by the deceased.' 37\n\n\n\nIn subsequent issues, the Sporting News published a series of tributes to Pike, indicating his stature as one of the greats of his time:\n\n\n\nPike was the center fielder of the Atlantics of Brooklyn in the latter's palmiest days and as an all-round batsman, fielder and base runner he had few if any superiors. He was a left-handed batsman and in his day could hit the ball as hard as any man in the business. He was a right field hitter and during his career had sent balls over the right field fence of nearly every park in which he had played in.38\n\n\n\nPike...was one of the few sons of Israel who ever drifted to the business of ball playing. He was a handsome fellow when he was here, and the way he used to hit that ball was responsible for many a scene of enthusiasm at the old avenue grounds...The roster of ball players who once wore the red and who have been called out by Umpire Death is not very large, but in the passing away of 'Lip' Pike one of the greatest sluggers who ever batted for Cincinnati has joined the file in eternity.39\n\n\n\nThe death of 'Lip' Pike removes another of the veterans of the seventies from the ranks of the men who played as stars when most of the present favorites were babies. I remember Pike's ball playing best through a hit which I saw him make at Cincinnati...He hit the first ball pitched and none who saw that ball sail out over the right fielder's head will ever forget it. It went not only over the right field fence, but continued to sail until it cleared the brick kiln beyond and dropped into the high weeds bordering on Mill Creek. I am impressed with the belief that if the distance could be measured that hit of Pike's would go on record as the longest fly ball ever made. The last time I saw Pike - which was during the New York's last series of Championship games at Eastern Park - we rode together in the elevated train from the ball ground, and he recalled that famous home run with a great deal of pride. Some one of the players on that day had made a home run, and 'Lip' could not refrain from comparing it with the greatest incident in his professional career.\n\n\n\n...Those who knew Pike appreciated him most. He was one of the few ball players of those days who were always gentlemanly on and off the field, a specie which is becoming rarer as the game grows older. Such men as Pike, Barnes, Spalding, Reach, Jim White, George Wright, and Morill, creditable to the game professionally and personally, are becoming scarcer every year.40\n\n\n\nSeveral honors came to Lipman Pike in the years following his death. The publisher of Philadelphia's prestigious Sporting Life, Francis Richter, constructed hypothetical All-Star teams in 1911. Richter selected Pike as one of his three outfielders for the 1870-1880 time period.\n\n\n\nThe Base Ball Writers of America held the inaugural election for the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown in 1936. Despite the fact that Pike had been dead for more than forty three years and his playing career had ended years before most, if not all, of the electors were born, he still received one vote. So to some small extent his achievement as baseball's first notable slugger was recognized.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Big Book of Jewish Baseball reports that Lipman Pike was elected to the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Netanya, Israel, in 1985.41\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n","thing_uuid":"{20C969F3-AF8D-4B7B-8E53-2E5D84BB7F91}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04170","objects_customfield_6":"INT'L HEBREW HERITAGE LIBR.,VOL.X,PG 125.28,INT'L BOOK CORP 1969","objects_customfield_5":"Pike, Boaz (1842 - 1912)","objects_objtype":"NEW YORK CLIPPER","objects_date":"12/5/1857","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Jews are listedl","descript_1":"Box score on the last page showing Boaz and Lipman Pike both on the Atlantics in the championship played against Eureaka in Newark, New Jersey","person_nam":"Pike, Boaz","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Pike, Boaz","location":"New York, NY","date":"1857-12-05T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder B","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"32","tiff_locat":"lbr_fb_s32_1r.tif; lbr_fb_s32_1v.tif; lbr_fb_s32_2r.tif; lbr_fb_s32_2v.tif; lbr_fb_s32_3r.tif; lbr_fb_s32_3v.tif; lbr_fb_s32_4r.tif; lbr_fb_s32_4v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.00597,40.714269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1614,"longitude":-74.00596993,"latitude":40.7142694,"ref_1":"ref4721","ref_2":"cid4637355","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Periodicals","descriptio":"bOX SCORE ON THE LAST PAGE SHOWING BOTH OF THEM ON THE SAME TEAM...THE ATLANTICS;.\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE 1ST TIME I HAVE SEEN THEM LISTED TOGETHER..LIPMAN HAD 6 RUNS & BENJAMIN(Boaz?)

Convention was 9/6/1853 & 9/7/1853\n\n\n\nBeyond the well-known Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, many smaller women_�_s rights and abolitionist conventions were held throughout the antebellum era. This 1853 meeting took place in the Broadway Tabernacle, located just a few blocks north of the American Museum. Participants, who included such prominent reformers as William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Coffin Mott, and William H. Channing, outlined a number of principles and argued that the existence of equal rights would not force all women to exercise them. Channing_�_s reference to Jenny Lind, the _�Swedish Nightingale_� who became famous in the U.S. thanks to P. T. Barnum, suggests the degree to which Barnum_�_s promotion of her as an _�ideal_� woman had permeated the popular consciousness.\n\n \n\nErnestine Rose was born in Poland in 1810. Fleeing an arranged marriage at the age of 16, Rose traveled around Europe, arriving in England in 1830. There, she became a follower of the noted social reformer Robert Owen and honed her skills as a popular public orator.\n\n\n\nRose arrived in America with her husband, a jeweler, in 1836, ready, apparently, for a fight. She learned, soon after her arrival, that a bill proposed to the New York legislature would grant married women the right to control their own property and earnings. Rose drew up a petition, worked for five months to gain supporters, and submitted the first petition (bearing five signatures) on this topic to the state legislature. Passage of New York's Married Women's Property Act was secured in 1848.\n\n\n\nRose became a central figure among woman's rights advocates and a close colleague of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Anthony celebrated Rose_�_s inspiration to the movement, describing her as the _�most eloquent speaker on our platform,_� keeping Rose_�_s portrait over her desk, and adopting her slogan, _�Agitate, agitate._�\n\n\n\nRose attended every national woman's rights convention between 1850 and 1869, serving as president of the fifth national convention in Philadelphia from October 17-19, 1854. In Philadelphia, Rose declared, [I]s woman not included in that phrase, 'all men are created...equal'? ...Tell us, ye men of the nation...whether woman is not included in that great Declaration of Independence?\n\n\n\nRose worked tirelessly traveling to twenty-three states to speak out for women's rights, against slavery and, eventually, for the rights of freed slaves, until she and her husband returned to England in 1869. Rose was not active as a Jew, but she did engage in a published debate in which she attacked anti-Semitism and praised the contributions of Jews throughout history.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{70861242-E669-48B6-A8D5-5B1D16310438}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04149","objects_customfield_6":"Biograhical Dictionary of Early American Jews by Rosenbloom","objects_customfield_5":"ROSE, ERNESTINE, L.","objects_objtype":"NEW.

It had stains. This correspondence is much less is historically important than the correspondence of the Jews of Newport. Neither the American Jewish Archives nor the American Jewish Historical Society posses a copy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristically, American Jews chose not to unite and dispatch one letter to congratulate Washington on his inauguration. Instead three different letters where sent. The congregation in Newport, Rhode Island sent its own letter as noted above.\n\n\n\nThe most important of the letters came in the correspondence of the Jews of Newport. They declined to sign the letters sent by the other congregations. This may have been because the citizenry of Rhode Island were divided on whether or not to join the new union and the state's Jews may have been hesitant to make a public statement on the matter by writing to the newly elected president. Nonetheless, when the Washington visited Newport in 1790, Moses Seixas, the warden of the congregation, addressed him on its behalf. Washington replied: For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support . . . May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants. \n\n\n\nDuring the struggle for the passage of the Maryland Jew Bill (to eliminate Jewish disabilities in the state) at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one supporter, Col. William G.D. Worthington, delivered an address before state legislature and read the entire correspondence between the Jews of Newport and Washington, and he cited from the exchanges with the other communities. The letters continued to be cited by Jews and their advocates throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to demonstrate that the Founding Father had sanctioned their inclusion in the American nation. The letter to Newport Jewry continues to be read in a public ceremony hosted annually by the city's Touro Synagogue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communities of Philadelphia, New York, Charleston and Richmond sent one jointly. In response to the good wished expressed in the latter letter, Washington reciprocated: May the same temporal and eternal blessings which you implore for me, rest upon your Congregations. While the Jews of Savannah sent a third letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1797 a book was published with the official correspondence of President George Washington. It contains the correspondence exchanged between Washington and the Jewish community of Newport and the communities of Philadelphia, Charleston, New York and Richmond. (It also contains a second letter penned by Moses Seixas, this one in his capacity as the master of a local Masonic lodge.) Interestingly the book does not contain the Savannah letter. \n\n\n\nNeither the American Jewish Archives nor the American Jewish Historical Society posses a copy.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{89F31652-B599-4E22-AA8B-BAE722DD16D9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04257","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04257","objects_customfield_5":"SEIXAS, MOSES","objects_objtype":"GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES","objects_date":"9/15/1790","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Article with letter written by Moses M.

They declined to sign the letters sent by the other congregations. This may have been because the citizenry of Rhode Island were divided on whether or not to join the new union and the state's Jews may have been hesitant to make a public statement on the matter by writing to the newly elected president. Nonetheless, when the Washington visited Newport in 1790, Moses Seixas, the warden of the congregation, addressed him on its behalf. Washington replied: For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support . . . May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants. \n\n\n\nDuring the struggle for the passage of the Maryland Jew Bill (to eliminate Jewish disabilities in the state) at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one supporter, Col. William G.D. Worthington, delivered an address before state legislature and read the entire correspondence between the Jews of Newport and Washington, and he cited from the exchanges with the other communities. The letters continued to be cited by Jews and their advocates throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to demonstrate that the Founding Father had sanctioned their inclusion in the American nation. The letter to Newport Jewry continues to be read in a public ceremony hosted annually by the city's Touro Synagogue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communities of Philadelphia, New York, Charleston and Richmond sent one jointly.

Many of his songs championed social causes like abolition, temperance, and reform of mental asylums.\n\n\n\nRussell was a great-nephew of the British Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschel. He began his career as a child singer in Elliston���s Children���s Opera company. While playing the organ at the Presbyterian church in Rochester, New York he discovered that sacred music, played quickly, makes the best kind of secular music. Old Hundredth, played very fast, became the music for Get out of de way, Ol' Dan Tucker.\n\n\n\nIn 1841, he returned to England and performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London with instant success.

Many of his songs championed social causes like abolition, temperance, and reform of mental asylums.\n\n\n\nRussell was a great-nephew of the British Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschel. He began his career as a child singer in Elliston���s Children���s Opera company. While playing the organ at the Presbyterian church in Rochester, New York he discovered that sacred music, played quickly, makes the best kind of secular music. Old Hundredth, played very fast, became the music for Get out of de way, Ol' Dan Tucker.\n\n\n\nIn 1841, he returned to England and performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London with instant success.

This controversy set important precendent on State's Rights.  Published in Richmond by Thomas Ritchie, printer for the Commonwealth, in 1821. \n\n\n\n Philip and Mendez Cohen of Norfolk were selling the D.C. lottery tickets in Norfolk, VA contrary to Virginia Law. The Supreme Court took up the complaint since it tested the relationship of Federal law to state laws. In Cohens v. Virginia crowned a series of decisions asserting the Supreme Court's authority to, in the words of Marshall, decide all cases of every description under the laws of the United States. In this 1821 decision, Marshall legally demolished the claims of states' rights which would politically plunge the nation into Civil War in 1861: The Constitution and laws of a state, insofar as they are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States are absolutely void.\n\n\n\nIt was a cynical appeal, brought by two highly paid lawyers, on behalf of two speculators hoping to reap a multi-state harvest from a District of Columbia lottery. But it provided Chief Justice Marshall with grounds to assert the supremacy of the Union over the states. In words that anticipated those of Abraham Lincoln in defending the Union 40 years later, Marshall unequivocally asserted the We, the People with which the Constitution began meant the Union, Congress and the Supreme Court created by that Constitution reigned over the states: The United States form . . . a single nation . . . In war, we are one people. In all commercial regulations, we are one and the same people. In many other respects, the American people are one; and the government which is alone capable of controlling and managing their interests in all these respects is the government of the Union. It is their government, and in that character they have no other, Marshall declared in perhaps his most important decision--and in some of his most ringing words: America has chosen to be a . . . nation; and for all these purposes, her government is complete . . . it is competent . . . it is supreme.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{B3660BFA-9E05-4FC7-A279-EDAF041D6A0D}","objects_refno":"2010.12.22.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2010.12.22.00001","objects_customfield_5":"Cohen, Philip/ Cohen, Mendez","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/1/1821","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Govt.

Moses Marcus\n\n\n\nThe appendix comprises pages [23]-37 and details how a few, who contribute little, are able to manipulate the ouster of himself and his predecessors after their one year appointment. Two of the objections to him were that he was a Jew and a foreigner. \n\n\n\nThe Episcopal Church owes its establishment in Nantucket to the efforts of the Rev. Moses Marcus, \n\nwho, in 1837, visited the island to perform the wedding ceremony of his son, who was living here after serving on a whaling ship and then being employed by the newspaper, the Inquirer. . Realizing that he was the first preacher of the Episcopal faith to be on the island, he stayed and ministered to a new group that was interested in the denomination.  A church was organized in 1838, and Mr. Marcus was appointed the first Rector. The new church, known as Trinity, was built on the site of the Friends' meeting-house in Broad Street. The meeting house was moved to the rear of the lot, and remodeled into a chapel and Sunday-school room, while the church itself was erected on the front of the lot, being consecrated September 18, 1839,   and was the last building on the north side of Broad Street to be destroyed in the Great Fire. For two years the congregation met at the First Congregational Church, but it essentially dissolved as Trinity Episcopal. Discussion among the trustees resulted in the change of name to St. Paul's Episcopal Church (by vote of seven to six over St. John's), the church reorganized. A new building was built on Fair Street and used until 1901 when the current building was built on the same site.\n\n\n\nNY: Protestant Episcopal Press. Good; removed from bound volume... 1837.

He began to see himself as possessing a special role in the gathering of the Jews back into Palestine. Brothers differed from the Puritans of the last century however, by asserting that he would also gather the _��Jews_�_ who were hidden amongst the population of Great Britain. In similarity to modern British-Israelists, Brothers asserted that the _��hidden Israel_�_ had no notion of its biological lineage and that part of his role would be to teach them of their true identity and lead them to the land of Canaan. Brothers proclaimed himself to be Prince of the Hebrews, literal descendant of the Biblical House of David, and the Nephew of the Almighty who would rule over Israel until the return of Jesus Christ. Brothers declared he would achieve all this using a rod he had fashioned from a wild rosebush with which he would perform miracles like Moses had done.\n\n\n\nAll this was declared in the first British-Israel publication: _��A REVEALED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPHECIES AND TIMES, Book the First, wrote [sic] under the direction of the LORD GOD and published by His Sacred Command, it being the first sign of Warning for the benefit of All Nations; Containing with other great and remarkable things not revealed to any other Person on Earth, the Restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem by the year of 1798 under their revealed Prince and Prophet (i.e., Richard Brothers).

This was the consecration of an existing building that the Congregation purchased and converted.\n\n\n\nThis exact copy is listed in Singerman as the only known copy.\n\n\n\nHistory��_��_Congregation Rodeph Shalom of Philadelphia, founded in 1795, is the oldest Ashkenazic synagogue in the Western Hemisphere. It is noted historically for its leadership of the Reform movement among American Hebrew congregations. \n\n\n\nFounded informally as a minyan of ten worshipers in 1795 by Orthodox Jews from Germany, Holland, and Poland, Rodeph Shalom adopted its first Articles of Association in 1802 and was the first synagogue in Pennsylvania to receive a corporate charter in 1812. Its records were kept in Yiddish until 1810 and in German until 1830] and it was known mainly as the congregation of recent immigrants until 1840. The congregation differentiated itself from Mikveh Israel mainly by offering Philadelphia Jews of northern European origin membership at reduced rates and, in cases of hardship, gratis. Welfare provisions were prominent features of Rodeph Shalom's constitution; rabbis were permitted to extend aid of up to five dollars to any sick or poor person, for example. But there was a price for these amenities: absence from Friday evening or Saturday morning services was punishable by fine, excused only by sickness or travel out of town.\n\nServices were held during the congregation's first seven decades in a variety of locations: initially in a building on Margaretta Street before Second; after 1820 at 1 Bread (Moravian) Street; by 1830 at 7 Pear Alley (Chancellor Street); and until 1840 at 15 Vine Street and at Fifth and Cherry. Relatively late in its history, then, the congregation finally built its first building in 1866, a Moorish Revival sanctuary designed by Philadelphia Frank Furness on North Broad Street.\n\n\n\nArticle Occident October 1847��_.On Wednesday, the 8th of September, the 27th of Elul, the interesting ceremony .. took place, with all the solemnity which is usually observed on such occasions. The crowd in attendance was very large, and nearly every seat, and many temporary ones had been prepared for the day, was occupied; and we observed several clergymen and other respectable Christian citizens among those present. ��_the service was nearly identical with the one at the consecration of the new Synagogue in New York, The officiating ministers, besides ourself, were the Rev. Naphthali Kahn, the Hazan of the congregation; and the Rev. Gabriel Papp��, of the Congregation Beth Israel. The music for the occasion was composed, or where not original, arranged by Mr. Samuel Ehrlich��_ we only express the general opinion when we say that parts of it were really beautiful. ��_We do not like to find fault; but as it will not do to praise every thing, we must express our regret that. some of the instrumental pieces, for instance that performed during the collection, were too little of a devotional character, entirely too loud.  We must at the same time state that particularly one of the choruses, the ?? ?? ??????, was beautifully composed and elegantly executed, and it deserves to be published as a fine specimen of Hebrew devotional music. ...The collection was made during an interval of the service; but the sums, written upon the subscription papers handed round before the commencement of the service were not read out aloud, a procedure which we highly approved of. We have received no official statement of the amount received, but understand that it was quite considerable��_.. The Synagogue is the largest in the city, and will contain in the main body at least five hundred persons, though the seats up now are only for about half of this number. The gallery, which extends on three sides, will hold about two hundred and fifty, with ease. There is a fine basement room, extending under the whole building, which will probably be used hereafter by the congregation as a school-room, a purpose for which it is now employed by the directors of the public schools, who have not yet vacated it, which is much to be regretted, as it has prevented the congregation from making all the alterations they at first contemplated.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{F4CC6F06-577E-47AF-8373-00366DB37111}","objects_refno":"2010.09.11.00001","objects_customfield_6":"This exact copy is listed in Singerman as the only known copy.","objects_customfield_5":"This exact copy is listed in Singerman as the only known copy.","objects_objtype":"Pamphlet","objects_date":"9/8/1847","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"Order of Services at the Consecration of Synagogue Rodef Sholum of Philadelphia","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Congregation Rodeph Shalom","merger":"Congregation Rodeph Shalom","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1847-09-08T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"Phila Pamphlet 35","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_pam_35_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_2v.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_3r.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_3v.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_4r.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_4v.tif; doc_ja_phil_pam_35_5r.tif; doc_ja_phil","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2181,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref4130","ref_2":"cid4637938","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Books","descriptio":"Dibdin, Thomas.

It is written during his trip to and at the Fourth Zionist Conference in1900. It starts with him staying in NYC on the way to 4th WZC. He meets with many notables to make his points. The Fourth Zionist Congress was noted for; discussing persecution of Romanian Jewry and the problems of Jewish workers in Palestine. \n\n\n\nImportantly it is at the Fourth Zionist Congress that the great scholar Solomon Schechter convinces Hoffman to give up the Law and study to become a pulpit Rabbi.\n\n\n\nRabbi Charles Isaiah Hoffman (1864-1945), well know as one of the first Rabbi's in America to move an Orthodox Synagogue to the Conservative Movement as espoused by Solomon Schechter. Hoffman personified Conservatism through and through and was an active leader in the Conservative Movement. During his formative adult years and as a Rabbi, Solomon Schechter was his friend and mentor\n\nHe was born in Philadelphia in to a German Jewish family he studied law at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1880. In 1887, he helped to found the Jewish Exponent. He was one of the first editors and served until 1898. During this period, Hoffman was the Secretary of the Association for the Protection of Jewish Immigrants of Philadelphia. An active Zionist he was the prototypical Jewish community activist.\n\n\n\nHis early Jewish education was under Rabbi Sabato Morais (founder of the first JTS). He was a member of Rodeph Shalom, but much to his dismay by 1895 they were moving into the Reform camp. It was at that time his life took a major turn; he met Solomon Schechter and was on the path to become the great scholar's disciple. \n\n\n\nHe was a delegate to the Fourth Zionist Conference in1900 and after conferring with Schechter gave up the law to study for the Rabbinate. He was a member of the first graduating class of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\n\n\nIn 1906 he became the Rabbi Oheb Shalom, in Newark, New Jersey. It was an Orthodox congregation that was ready for a movement to Conservatism. Rabbi Hoffman had strong beliefs about the role of rabbi which was influenced by his long association with his beloved friend, Solomon Schechter. Rabbi Hoffman and Dr. Schechter challenged the membership to build new styles, new practices, new rituals as Jewish as the Torah and as American as apple pie.

Nassy, born in Surinam into its leading Sephardi family, was a descendant of David Nassy, who had founded the Jewish community there in 1664. The younger David first appears in 1785 as a signatory to a petition for a college of letters in Surinam. Shortly thereafter he became president of the Regenten (board) of the local Jewish community, and in this capacity was the first signatory of a communication to the German Christian advocate of Jewish rights, Christian Wilhelm von *Dohm . At the latter's request, Nassy played a leading role in compiling Essai historique sur la Colonie de Surinam (2 vols., Paramaribo, 1788), a record of the Jewish role in the history of the colony. Restrictions on Jewish freedom led him to St. Thomas for a time and subsequently to Philadelphia (1792), where he was the first Jewish physician to practice in that city. An outbreak of yellow fever the following year brought him into conflict with his foremost colleague, Dr. Benjamin Rush, over diagnosis and treatment. Nassy published his findings in Observations on the Cause, Nature, and Treatment of the Epidemic Disorder Prevalent in Philadelphia (1793), in which he pointed out his success in losing only 19 patients (11 of whom had already received Rush's treatment) out of 117 afflicted. Nassy's scientific work earned him election to the American Philosophical Society. In 1795 he returned to Surinam, where he went into business. Three years later he published Lettre Politico-Theologico-Morale sur les Juifs (1798?) with a Dutch translation, supporting the emancipation of Dutch Jewry.\n\n\n\nThis work was written during a n outbreak of yellow fever, which Nassy had some success in diagnosing and treating.

He is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have a claim to the discovery.\n\n\n\nPriestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse Enlightenment rationalism with Christian theism. In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, materialism, and determinism, a project that has been called audacious and original. He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human progress and eventually bring about the Christian Millennium.  Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated toleration and equal rights for religious Dissenters, which also led him to help found Unitarianism in England. The controversial nature of Priestley's publications combined with his outspoken support of the French Revolution aroused public and governmental suspicion; he was eventually forced to flee, in 1791, first to London, and then to the United States, after a mob burned down his home and church. He spent the last ten years of his life living in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania\n\n","thing_uuid":"{6CE53C0C-CC28-463A-974D-A87C721CAB5D}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00656","objects_customfield_6":"NOT LISTED IN AN AMER.

He was an alternate delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, but shortly afterwards switched to the Republican party, to which he remained allied for the rest of his life. In 1862, he opened a law practice in Washington. After defending U. S. Grant against charges of anti-semitism, he held various government posts, including consul in Egypt, until 1882, when he resumed practicing law. Grant was not the only president that he knew, claiming acquaintance with every executive from Lincoln to Wilson.

Carey under the firm name of Carey & Hart. Many famous books were issued by them. Among the productions of their press were Griswold's Poets and Poetry of America (1842), and Longfellow's Poets and Poetry of Europe and his Poems (1845). They were the first to collect and publish separately the fugitive pieces of Macaulay, Jeffrey, and other well-known English essayists. The most celebrated book issued by Carey & Hart was the now very rare Yellowplush Correspondence (1838), the first book of Thackeray's ever published, preceding by several years the fir?t English edition of any of his works. In 1845 Carey withdrew from the firm, and Henry Carey Baird was associated with Abraham Hart under the name of Hart & Baird. Four years later Baird withdrew, and Hart continued the publishing business until 1854, when he retired. The firm had become one of the best-known publishing-houses in America.\n\n\n\nAbraham Hart was greatly interested in the Jewish charitable and educational societies of Philadelphia. He was president of the board of managers of the Jewish Foster Home, the (first) Jewish Publication Society, the board of trustees of Maimonides College, and the Mickv�� Israel congregation. He was for many years treasurer of the Hebrew Education Society (1848-75), and was interested in the establishment of the Jewish Hospital and the Young Men's Hebrew Association.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{97A2CE8F-6639-4C3E-9709-D0A23F42BC3D}","objects_refno":"2007.07.22.00001","objects_customfield_6":"History of Jews in Philadelphia by MAX WHITEMAN","objects_customfield_5":"Hart, Abraham (1810-1885)","objects_objtype":"CATALOGUE","objects_date":"4/1/1839","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Commercial","descript_1":"Duplicate of \"Carey and Hart's catalogue of choice, rare and valuable books , forming the most complete collection of English editions.\"","person_nam":"Hart, Abraham","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Hart, Abraham","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1839-04-01T00:00:00Z","container_":"Drawer","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Judaica Americana","containe_2":"Folder","containe_3":"PHIL 71","tiff_locat":"doc_ja_phil_71_1r.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_1v.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_2r.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_2v.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_3r.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_3v.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_4r.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_4v.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_5r.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_5v.tif; doc_ja_phil_71_6r.tif; d","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2228,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref4488","ref_2":"cid4637588","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Periodicals","descriptio":"An anti-Semitic comical poem in the center of the first page.

Representing Philadelphia's Aldermen, Dropsie appeals from a lower court decision enjoining the Aldermen from enforcing a new State law designed to prevent voting fraud. Dropsie argues the necessity for some law to prevent the perpetration of frauds, and protect the citizen in his right of suffrage. Existing law has not restrained the commission of frauds in elections in Philadelphia. The lower court declared that the law's application exclusively to Philadelphia violated the State Constitution's requirement that elections shall be free and equal. Dropsie explains the true meaning of the free and equal clause, and argues that it does not prohibit the enactment. \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{D3D81797-6ABD-40B3-9E38-3B029E924467}","objects_refno":"2012.02.28.00004","objects_customfield_6":"2012.02.28.00004","objects_customfield_5":"Dropsie, Moses A.","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"3/29/1869","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Govt.

In lieu of an editorial article upon a particular subject of our own selection, we will refer this month to the commencement of what we  ... we hope, is destined to exist many years, and to produce an abundant harvest of useful results to the cause of our religion in this country��_. The immigration into this country, from Germany especially, has regularly increased our population almost every month, ��_ far the greater number of the newcomers have but very limited means, and, many of them, but limited educations, and ��_. nevertheless they form a nucleus of future strength by their very presence; by industry and frugality ��_ they will seek for their children those advantages which they themselves had not the opportunity of enjoying��_it would evidently be the obligation of those who are more noble-hearted to awaken their fellow Israelites to a better sense of what they owe to themselves and their children. ��_we will be able to point to our success as a proof that, in the western world, also, Judaism has found a home, and numbers many friends and faithful adherents.\n\n\n\nHowever the history was rocky��_ the first Jewish Publication Society was initially founded in 1845 in Philadelphia, but was dissolved 6 years later after a fire destroyed the building and the entire JPS stock. The American Jewish Publication Society was then established in 1871, but folded only a few years later as a result of an economic downturn and organizational neglect. It was reestablished in 1888 and is active today.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{D8FD289F-08B8-4F17-8B6B-7AB124B8ED23}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01232","objects_customfield_6":"SINGERMAN NO. 881...3 COPIES LOCATED..NOT LISTED IN ROSENBACH","objects_customfield_5":"LEESER, ISAAC / HART, A / COHEN, H./ SAMUEL, D./ MOSS, J./  JONES, A./ GRATZ, H./ BOMEISLAR, L.","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/1/1845","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"Constitution and bylaws of the American Jewish Publication Society, adopted in Philadelphia on November 30th, 1845.

Stein , Philadelphia\n\n\n\nThis is an historical marker in Dutch Ashkenazim history in Philadelphia. Singerman, # 1504, locates only one copy and this is the copy.\n\n\n\nHISTORY_�_.Many Dutch Ashkenazim came to Philadelphia by 1830, according to Hurvich, Dutch immigrants comprised a quarter of the city's Jews. They included merchants and craftsmen of varying incomes. But, after 1848, the Dutch Jews of Philadelphia found themselves lost in the great wave of German Jewish immigration.\n\n\n\nIn the 1850s, the Dutch Jews of South Philadelphia founded Congregation B'nai Israel as an ethnic synagogue, and they soon purchased a burial ground, which came to be administered by a Hebrew Mutual Benefit and Benevolent Society of Brotherly Love. Several Jewish veterans of the Civil War were interred on its grounds. It was maintained separately from the adjoining Mount Moriah Cemetery, which currently remains open. The congregation remained in existence until 1879, when its members left to join other synagogues in Philadelphia. Its last president, Joseph Sanson, was born in Amsterdam in 1825 and immigrated to America in 1839. As an adult, he moved to Philadelphia; his fluency in nine languages earned him the title of the court angel for his unpaid services as interpreter in the city's courts, and especially for his assistance to recent Jewish immigrants.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{62347A83-8D7A-4694-823E-17619AACA37E}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01287","objects_customfield_6":"JUDAICA AMERICANA BY SINGERMAN # 1504 may only be one other copy","objects_customfield_5":"NUMEROUS NAMES","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"1/8/1857","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Religious Related","descript_1":"Pamphlet marking the consecration of the new synagogue of the congregation B'nai Israel in Philadelphia, founded by Dutch Jews in the 1850s.

Cohen, felt rather strongly about the issue of slavery and used his daily newspaper as a herald against it. Mr. Cohen had been active in Philadelphia civic affairs and compiled its City Directory in 1860 (Morais, The Jews of Philadelphia).

Both lists are included in this issue in their entirety, and read just as can be found on the internet (photos show portions).\n\n\n\nSeveral provisions of the Declaration of Rights proposed by the first North Carolina convention in 1788 made their way into the Bill of Rights. These include freedom of speech and religion, the right to a jury trial, and the right to due process of law.\n\n\n\nAs expected, North Carolina's convention voted down the Constitution. The majority insisted that the new central government's powers were too broad, and that the Constitution must be amended to limit and clarify those powers. By that time, though, the Constitution had already taken effect - just not in North Carolina. New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution on June 21, 1788, and as of that date, the Constitution became the official government of the nine states that had ratified it. By the time North Carolina's convention left town on August 2, only North Carolina and Rhode Island were left outside the union.\n\n\n\nAs a practical matter, there was no way that North Carolina could survive on its own, as an independent state surrounded by a separate nation. Other states that ratified the Constitution had also requested that a Bill of Rights be added, and by the fall of 1789 it became clear that the Constitution would be amended. In a second convention, North Carolina ratified the Constitution on November 21, 1789.\n\n\n\nThis issue is a great historical record of the work of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention. Complete in 4 pages, measures 9 by 11 inches, a bit irregular at the blank spine margin not affecting any text, otherwise in great condition.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{3BF5EA47-B06D-4C3A-81E3-004093EF33E3}","objects_refno":"2009.10.09.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2009.10.09.00001","objects_customfield_5":"","objects_objtype":"THE  INDEPENDENT GAZETTEER","objects_date":"8/30/1788","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Articles regarding the creation of the U.S. Constitution and the North Carolina Constitutional Convention's proposed ammendments and declaration of rights","person_nam":"","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"Independent Gazetteer","merger":"Independent Gazetteer","location":"Philadelphia, PA","date":"1788-08-30T00:00:00Z","container_":"Box","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"5","containe_2":"Object","containe_3":"4","tiff_locat":"bx5_4_1r.tif; bx5_4_1v.tif; bx5_4_2r.tif; bx5_4_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.163789,39.952339]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2239,"longitude":-75.16378919,"latitude":39.95233852,"ref_1":"ref4534","ref_2":"cid4637542","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Periodicals","descriptio":"YELLOW FEVER REPORT..NOTES MR.

This rare newspaper is the only printing of  Benjamin Nones famous editorial I am a Jew...The editorial runs 1 1/2 full pages, he was also accused  of fleeing bankruptcy and notes that we was cleared of that bankruptcy (1795). Our Collection houses the document that proves his claim. This editorial is an historical marker in American Jewish history. It was the first to respond to anti- anti-Semitic attacks.\n\n\n\nArticle by Michael Feldberg (AJHS): \n\n\n\nIn the early Republic, the first two political parties, Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans routinely and falsely charged one another with corruption, sexual scandal and even treason. In Philadelphia in 1800, the Federalists introduced anti-Semitism into the political fray. \n\n\n\nA vivid example is the vicious attack launched against Benjamin Nones. Born in France in 1757, Nones immigrated to Philadelphia around 1772. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Nones chose to fight for his adopted nation. In 1777, Nones saw heavy action as part of General Pulaski's legion. He earned the rank of major with a citation for bravery. \n\n\n\nAfter the war, Nones returned to Philadelphia a war hero, but struggled to make a living. As a notary public and government interpreter, he barely earned enough to feed his growing family, which eventually numbered 14 children. Nonetheless, he was active in civic and Jewish communal affairs. Nones served as an officer of the Society of Ezrath Orchim, the first organized Jewish charity in Philadelphia and as president of that city's Congregation Mikveh Israel. He was also an active member of an anti-slavery society. \n\n\n\nPhiladelphia was rife with political rivalry throughout the 1790s with Nones in the thick of it. The conservative Federalists, representing the interests of merchants and financial speculators, battled Jeffersonian Republicans, who presented themselves as the party of small businessmen, farmers, artisans and laborers. Many Jews in the young nation leaned toward the Jeffersonians, considering them more favorable to religious liberty for minorities. \n\n\n\nThe Federalists responded to the Jewish penchant for Jeffersonianism with a barrage of anti-Semitic attacks. In August 1800, Benjamin Nones became their target. \n\n\n\nThat summer Nones participated in a Republican convention in Philadelphia. The city's leading Federalist newspaper, the Gazette, published a scurrilous account of the meeting, calling all who attended the filth of society. It singled out Nones for its ugliest attack. Citizen N----, it sneered, was a Jew, a Republican, and poor, the three worst epithets in the Federalists' lexicon. \n\n\n\nNones immediately penned an impassioned response. When the Gazette refused to publish it, even as a paid article, he took it to the Aurora, the city's Jeffersonian newspaper, which was happy to run it. Although hot with indignation, Nones's reply conveys a dignity that transcends nearly two centuries. \n\n\n\nI am a Jew. I glory in belonging to that persuasion, which even its opponents, whether Christian, or Mahomedan, allow to be of divine origin -- of that persuasion on which Christianity itself was originally founded, and must ultimately rest -- which has preserved its faith secure and undefiled, for near three thousand years, whose votaries have never murdered each other in religious wars, or cherished the theological hatred so general, so inextinguishable among those who revile them.... \n\nI am a Republican!...I have not been so proud or so prejudiced as to renounce the cause for which I have fought, as an American throughout the whole of the revolutionary war....I am a Jew, and if for no other reason, for that reason am I a republican...In republics we have rights, in monarchies we live but to experience wrongs ....

He proceeded at once to the mines on the South Fork of the American river but, without remaining long, returned to Sacramento and entered the mercantile firm of Hensley, Reading & Co. of that place as a partner and book-keeper. From there, in the autumn of 1849 he returned to San Francisco and on December 5, 1849, in conjunction with Jacob R. Snyder, established and opened the banking house of James King of Wm. & Co. on the southwest corner of Montgomery and Washington streets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 5, 1852, Snyder withdrew from the firm, and King then carried on the business alone, under the name of  James King of William. He succeeded in inspiring confidence in his integrity and made money as well as reputation. In May, 1851, his family, then consisting of a wife and four children, joined him; and, with brilliant prospects ahead, he erected for them a fine residence, kept horses and a carriage and lived in a style befitting his position as a prosperous banker. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe was always exceedingly outspoken in the expression of his sentiments; and in various positions, and particularly as foreman of the grand jury of San Francisco in 1853, he was called upon to take a prominent and positive stand in reference to the moral and social abominations and the political corruptions which were reeking on every side of him. He was not found wanting at this task: on the contrary he got the reputation of, and became widely known as, a man, not only of honor and integrity but also of intelligence and courage. \n\n\n\n Unfortunately for him his employees were not all as honest, or at least as prudent, as himself; and one of them, by investing in certain mining and ditch property in Tuolumne County, involved him in difficulties, which threatened and in fact brought him to the verge of financial ruin. In June 1854, while King was in this position and suffering great anxiety for fear of not being able to meet his engagements, Isaiah C. Woods of the express and banking house of Adams & Co. proposed that, if he would turn over all his assets and enter the service of Adams & Co., that firm would assume all his liabilities and pay him a salary of a little over a thousand dollars per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe accepted the offer, supposing the house to be perfectly solvent; and the house on its part readily ratified the bargain, knowing that King's assets with good management would be more than enough to meet all his liabilities and that his reputation for honesty would be worth much more than any possible loss by employing him. The contract was an employment for two years from June 27, 1854. For a short time everything went on well. But by degrees he became very much dissatisfied with Woods' methods of business and also with several of Woods' friends. One of these was Alfred A. Cohen, against whom he appears to have felt a great antipathy. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a few days after entering the house King expressed his dislike of Cohen; but, on Woods' representations that Cohen was a good friend of Adams & Co., King agreed to suppress his feelings. Sometime in August, however, according to King's statement, a conversation occurred in reference to a sale of gold-dust said to have been made by Cohen, as broker for Adams & Co., to Page, Bacon & Co.; and the result was very great ill-feeling between the two men. Both were evidently very hot-tempered.\n\n\n\n\n\n On July 14, 1855, a few months after the failure of Page, Bacon & Co. and Adams & Co. and the extensive losses among all classes of the people caused thereby, and while very great excitement prevailed in reference to the frauds that were supposed to have been perpetrated in the management of the Adams & Co. affairs, King published a newspaper card to the effect that Woods had on more than one occasion, in his presence and the presence of others, said that Adams & Co. made a hundred thousand dollars a year out of sales of gold-dust to Page, Bacon & Co. But he added that he himself had not had the slightest idea, until within five or six days, of any improper means having been made use of by Woods to effect such sales, which he then charged had been the case. \n\n\n\nThree days afterwards King and Cohen met in front of Barrett & Sherwood's jewelry store on Montgomery Street; and after a few heated words in reference to King's card, an encounter took place between them in which neither was hurt, but Cohen considered himself insulted. Later on the same day, evidently taking that view of the subject, and yielding to the then prevalent opinion on the subject of dueling, Cohen sent King a challenge. The challenge was carried to King by John K. Hackett; and the next day King replied, by letter to Hackett and through the newspapers, declining to fight and giving as his chief reasons his duty to his family and his opposition to dueling on moral grounds. At the same time King announced that while nothing could induce him to change his principles upon the subject of dueling, his conscience was perfectly easy as to the right and propriety of defending himself if he should be assaulted.\n\n \n\nThis open refusal on the part of King to fight a duel, being the first instance in California in which a prominent man born south of Mason and Dixon's line had taken that stand, at once raised him much higher than he stood before in the estimation of those classes of the community who were opposed to dueling. Though southern men still adhered to the code, as it was called, most Northern men were opposed to it. The general public sentiment of the community was violently opposed to it, as was indicated by the adoption of the provision of the constitution of 1849, which declared that no citizen, thereafter fighting a duel or sending or accepting a challenge or who should act as second or knowingly aid or assist in a duel, should be allowed to hold any office of profit or enjoy the right of suffrage, and the statutes of the legislature of 1850, making the same acts felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Such being the case, though little respect was paid to the constitution or the statute by public men, King's stand on the subject, on account of its accordance with the law and its being recognized as dictated by enlightened principle, was considered as doing him great credit and gained him very great applause. Nearly all the newspapers of the day heartily praised it; and no one dared to openly disapprove obedience to the constitution and statutes. Though some duels have since taken place and some men still adhere or profess to adhere to the code, few or no duels between otherwise respectable men have taken place for a number of years; and James King of William, more than any other man, is entitled to the praise of having started the movement that put a stop to the barbarous practice.\n\n\n\nJames King of William is challenged to a duel by Mr. Alfred Cohen but refuses on moral reasons.\n\nCohen, Alfred A.; capitalist, and a lawyer of great ability; was born in London, England, July 17, 1829; died on the railroad train, near Sydney, Nebraska, while returning from N.

Though southern men still adhered to the code, as it was called, most Northern men were opposed to it. The general public sentiment of the community was violently opposed to it, as was indicated by the adoption of the provision of the constitution of 1849, which declared that no citizen, thereafter fighting a duel or sending or accepting a challenge or who should act as second or knowingly aid or assist in a duel, should be allowed to hold any office of profit or enjoy the right of suffrage, and the statutes of the legislature of 1850, making the same acts felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.\n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{84A9CD8A-3E46-4474-B338-F2E467EC1BDE}","objects_refno":"2010.01.04.00001","objects_customfield_6":"History of California, Volume 3 By Theodore Henry Hittell","objects_customfield_5":"Cohen, Alfred","objects_objtype":"National Intelligencer, Washington","objects_date":"9/4/1855","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Jews are listedl","descript_1":"James King of William is challenged to a duel by Mr. Alfred Cohen but refuses on moral reasons","person_nam":"Cohen, Alfred E.","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Cohen, Alfred E.","location":"San Francisco, CA","date":"1855-09-04T00:00:00Z","container_":"Box","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"7","containe_2":"Object","containe_3":"3","tiff_locat":"bx7_3_1r.tif; bx7_3_1v.tif; bx7_3_2r.tif; bx7_3_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.784567,43.083129]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2618,"longitude":-73.78456708,"latitude":43.0831292,"ref_1":"ref4614","ref_2":"cid4637462","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Periodicals","descriptio":"AMONG THE LIST PEOPLE PETIONING UNDER THE NEW INSOLVENT LAW; ALSO HAS A FIREY LETTER BY THE EDITOR URGING WAR WITH ENGLAND; ; ;","thing_uuid":"{65F26A8C-2BC3-4836-B821-9B6F12179B30}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04151","objects_customfield_6":"BIOGRAPHICAL DICT.

Congregation, to President George Washington along with his reply. It is on page one and two and in mint condition.\n\n\n\nThe Gazette of United States, 6/19/1790 with the Savannah letter to Washington and his reply on the second page recently sold at Kestenbaum Auction Lot # 257, May 27, 2010 (est. $7,000-9,000) for $12,300. It had stains. \n\n\n\nCharacteristically, American Jews chose not to unite and dispatch one letter to congratulate Washington on his inauguration. Instead three different letters where sent. The congregation in Savannah sent its own letter as noted above.\n\n\n\nThe communities of Philadelphia, New York, Charleston and Richmond sent one jointly. In response to the good wished expressed in the latter letter, Washington reciprocated: May the same temporal and eternal blessings which you implore for me, rest upon your Congregations. \n\n\n\nThe most important of the letters came in the correspondence of the Jews of Newport. They declined to sign the letters sent by the other congregations. This may have been because the citizenry of Rhode Island were divided on whether or not to join the new union and the state's Jews may have been hesitant to make a public statement on the matter by writing to the newly elected president. Nonetheless, when the Washington visited Newport in 1790, Moses Seixas, the warden of the congregation, addressed him on its behalf. Washington replied: For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support . . . May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants. \n\n\n\nDuring the struggle for the passage of the Maryland Jew Bill (to eliminate Jewish disabilities in the state) at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one supporter, Col. William G.D. Worthington, delivered an address before state legislature and read the entire correspondence between the Jews of Newport and Washington, and he cited from the exchanges with the other communities. The letters continued to be cited by Jews and their advocates throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to demonstrate that the Founding Father had sanctioned their inclusion in the American nation. The letter to Newport Jewry continues to be read in a public ceremony hosted annually by the city's Touro Synagogue.\n\n\n\nIn 1797 a book was published with the official correspondence of President George Washington. It contains the correspondence exchanged between Washington and the Jewish community of Newport and the communities of Philadelphia, Charleston, New York and Richmond. (It also contains a second letter penned by Moses Seixas, this one in his capacity as the master of a local Masonic lodge.) Interestingly the book does not contain the Savannah letter. \n\n","thing_uuid":"{8A18AC6C-3121-495B-8049-63C137C9DD9D}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.04255","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.04255","objects_customfield_5":"SHEFTAL, LEVI","objects_objtype":"GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES","objects_date":"6/19/1790","objects_coltype":"NEWSPAPER..Religious Related","descript_1":"Letter written by Levi Sheftel, President of the of Savannah, Georgia Congregation, to President George Washington along with his reply","person_nam":"Sheftal, Levi","person_n_1":"","corporatio":"","merger":"Sheftal, Levi","location":"Savannah, GA","date":"1790-06-19T00:00:00Z","container_":"Folder","container1":"Mixed materials","containe_1":"Binder A","containe_2":"Page","containe_3":"11","tiff_locat":"lbr_fa_s11_1r.tif; lbr_fa_s11_1v.tif; lbr_fa_s11_2r.tif; lbr_fa_s11_2v.tif","url":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.099829,32.083536]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2636,"longitude":-81.09982894,"latitude":32.08353578,"ref_1":"ref4830","ref_2":"cid4637247","genre":"Printed works","genre_subl":"Sheet Music","descriptio":"Sheet Music (Judaica) - Prince Imperial Quadrille��_ Composed by l.

His father, Samuel Levi, was a Jewish teacher, and expounder of rabbinical law. His mother supported the family by keeping a small shop. At six years of age he read the five books of Moses in the original, and was daily instructed by a private tutor in the Jewish law. \n\n\n\nAt twenty-one he became a leader in the synagogue. About this period, while journeying from Hamburg to Schwerin, he met a Christian, who suggested to him novel ideas regarding the Messiah. Remain in England and become an evangelist to his own people, \n\n\n\nIn 1816 he removed with his family to New York, established the Mulberry Street Congregationalist Church, and was ordained its pastor in 1818. In 1820 he founded the American society for meliorating the condition of the Jews. The object of this association was to establish an asylum for Christian Hebrews from all parts of the world. The enterprise proved a failure, and occupied several years of fruitless labor. In 1827, Mr. Frey, convinced of the necessity of immersion, left the Congregationalist Church and became a Baptist. In 1837 resigned his pastorate to go to Europe as an agent for the American society for the conversion of the Jews. He remained abroad three years, but the mission was not favorably received. He returned to New York, lectured weekly in the South Baptist Church to such Jews as He could induce to form his congregation, went on missionary journeys through the southern and southwestern states, and finally settled in Pontiac, Michigan, where he taught Hebrew in the preparatory department of the State University. His published works are Narrative of my Life (New York, 1809); Hebrew Bible (1811); Hebrew Grammar (1813'23); Judah and Israel (1837); Lectures of Scripture Types (1841); and Report of the Agency in Europe (1842).\n\n\n\n ROSENBACH...188   ONLY ONE COPY FOUND\n\n","thing_uuid":"{D4D6842E-543B-48F1-A1FC-8F31B94CC09C}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.01043","objects_customfield_6":"AN AMER.

Mordecai made a decision to retire from the U.S. Army at age 57, so he wouldn't have to fight against either side. His devotion to his conscience probably cost him a higher place in American history. When he resigned, he was one of the best military professionals in the country. He was on a par with all the well-known generals of the Civil War.

Printed by Thomas Allen. \n\n\n\nA scarce and historically significant imprint, in which the Committee from the Constitutional Convention of Florida, which met in January, 1839, at St. Joseph, Florida Territory, present this memorial to the U.S. Congress and Senate, asking that their proposed State Constitution be recognized, and that they be admitted into the Union as a State. Interesting language, noting that their census should not be the determining factor for admission, as there have been great difficulties in doing an accurate census because of the ongoing War with the Seminole Indians, and they point to a provision in the 1819 Treaty with Spain, by which Florida was acquired for the U.S., as providing for their Statehood. One of the committee members whose signature appears in type, is DAVID LEVY, who became the first Jewish U.S. Senator, upon Florida's admission to the Union in 1845. He changed his last name to Yulee, and thus has the distinction of having 2 counties in the same state named after him (Levy & Yulee counties). \n\n\n\nFollows with a complete printing of the Florida Constitution which was hammered out at the Convention, with the printed signatures of every member of the Constitutional Convention. There is also a printing of the 1838 Census of the Territory of Florida, lising Whites, Slaves and Free Blacks for each county. Dade County, today the most populated county in Fla., had a total population of 314 (including 29 slaves and 22 free Blacks). The total population of the Territory of Florida was 48,223, with over 21,000 being Slaves (nearly half the population!). \n\n\n\nNeatly disbound.

This is an important speech on the extradition of criminal to another country. This is before he changed his name to David Yulee and became the first Jewish Senator. It was exhibited at Library of Congress exhibit in Cincinnati (AJA) during 2005\n\n\n\nYulee was born David Levy (1810 - 1886) in Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas, during the British occupation of the Danish West Indies, now the United States Virgin Islands. His father, Moses Elias Levy, bought 50,000 acres of land near present-day Jacksonville to establish a New Jerusalem for Jewish settlers. \n\n\n\nAfter studying and practicing law in St. Augustine, David Levy became the delegate to United States Congress for the Florida Territory and was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate when Florida was admitted to the Union in 1845.[2] In 1846, he officially changed his name to David Levy Yulee (adding his father's ancestral Sephardic surname). After serving one term in the Senate, Yulee was defeated for re-election in 1850.\n\n\n\nThe next year, he founded a 5,000-acre (20 km2) sugar plantation along the Homosassa River. While living in Fernandina, he began to follow his dream to build a railroad across Florida. He had originally planned to build a state-owned system as far back as 1837, but in 1851, he became the first southerner to utilize federal grants by drawing up an Internal Improvement Act. Using federal and state land grants and public stock. The Florida Railroad was chartered in 1853. The terminals would be the deep water ports, Fernandina on Amelia Island on the Atlantic side and Cedar Key on the Gulf. Construction began in 1855 and on March 1, 1861, the first train arrived in Cedar Key, just weeks before the beginning of the Civil War.\n\n\n\nElected to the Senate again in 1855, he served until January 21, 1861, when he withdrew from the Senate after Florida seceded to join the Congress of the Confederacy. In 1865 he was imprisoned in Fort Pulaski due to his support for the Confederacy.] After his release from confinement, he rebuilt the Yulee Railroad, which had been destroyed during the war.

Lewis Charles Levin was the first Jewish person elected to the United States Congress.\n\n\n\nLewis Charles Levin (November 10, 1808-March 14, 1860) was a Philadelphia politician, prominent Know Nothing, and anti-Catholic social activist of the 1840s and 1850s. He served three terms in Congress (U.S. House of Representatives, 1845-51), representing the Pennsylvania 1st District. Levin is considered to have been the first Jewish Congressman.\n\n\n\nLewis Charles Levin was born in Charleston, South Carolina and graduated from South Carolina College (later the University of South Carolina) in 1828. He then briefly taught school in Woodville, Mississippi, but had to quit town after being wounded in a duel. Levin then read and practiced law in Maryland and Kentucky.\n\n\n\nBy 1838 Levin was in Philadelphia and giving public lectures on the evils of alcohol. He founded and edited a journal called the Temperance Advocate. In 1842 he staged an immense public bonfire of booze to draw attention to his campaign against taverns and for local control of liquor licensing. Levin's anti-alcohol crusade proved to be excellent preparation for his next cause, a campaign against Catholic political power, which he carried on in two papers, the Native American and The Daily Sun. Initially the main political issue was a 1843 public school ruling permitting Catholic children to be excused from Bible-reading class (because the Protestant King James Version was being used).\n\n\n\nLevin became the leader and chief spokesman for a start-up political movement calling itself the American Republican Party (later the American Nativist Party). Between May and July 1844 he gave speeches and led public demonstrations in Kensington and Southwark, leading to the looting and burning of several dozen houses, businesses and religious buildings. Levin and his colleague Samuel R. Kramer (publisher of the Native American) were arrested and fined for exciting to riot and treason in inciting locals to invade and burn several Catholic churches and a convent.\n\n\n\nShortly after the 1844 Philadelphia riots, Levin ran for Congress and was elected on his party's platform, to wit: (1) to extend the period of naturalization to twenty-one years; (2) to elect only native born to all offices; (3) to reject foreign interference in all institutions, social, religious, and political. Levin was returned to Congress in 1846 and 1848. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Engraving during the Thirtieth Congress, 1847-48. (As a side note, it was this Thirtieth Congress that saw a young Illinois lawyer named Abraham Lincoln serve his one and only term in the House.)\n\n\n\nAn Interesting back ground on the issues in the 1846 Levin election_�_. 1842 Hon. E. Joy Morris, of Pennsylvania, gave a speech in Defence of the Tariff of 1842, and the Protective Policy and American Labor. It was delivered in the House of Representatives of the United States, It was reprinted with an introduction addressed to the voters of the 1st congressional district exhorting them to vote for Morris, the Democratic Whig Tariff candidate in 1846, who was running against the American Party candidate, Lewis C. Levin. Levin won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Levin continued to campaign for the Native American or Know-Nothing movement, as it became known. He attempted to campaign for U.S. Senator, which prior to the 17th Amendment was a seat elected by the state legislature rather than by popular vote. Levin was accused of bribing members of the Pennsylvania Assembly, and was subpoenaed by a state investigation in February 1855. The findings were inconclusive but Levin never again held office. \n\nLevin and other Nativists helped tilt the 1852 Presidential election toward Democrat Franklin Pierce and away from the Whigs' candidate, the popular Mexican War leader General Winfield Scott. There were Catholics in Scott's family and he was accused of Papist connections.] Levin was an organizing speaker of the first Know-Nothing Party convention in March 1855. Though in notably failing health, he was a featured speaker at the American Order's rally that autumn in a New York City park\n\n.\n\n\n\nLevin was enraged and disgusted by the new Republican Party's nomination of John C. Fr��mont for President, at their convention in Philadelphia in June 1856. He wrote a lengthy diatribe against Fr��mont[10], which he delivered at a rally in Philadelphia's National Hall (now Independence Hall) shortly after Millard Fillmore had been nominated by both the Know Nothings and the Whigs. However, Fr��mont partisans pulled him off the stand[11][12]. According to newspaper reports, Levin suffered a complete mental collapse and became so deranged that he was placed in the Philadelphia Hospital for the Insane[13], where he died of Insanity in March 1860.[14] Levin was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery, in Philadelphia. After his death, his wife and child converted to Catholicism, independently of each other. [15]\n\n\n\nLewis Levin's role in a nativist party is sometimes deemed a paradox, despite the fact he was native-born himself. His opposition was not to immigration as such but rather to Catholicism; he eagerly sought support from non-Catholic immigrants. It is a mark of his skill that he was able to equate nativism with anti-Catholicism, and to do so in Philadelphia, where sectarian animosity had historically been minimal, and where native-born Catholics had lived side-by-side with Anglicans, Quakers, and others since the Colonial period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin was one of the most popular public speakers of his era, often quoted and anthologized, and painted by America's leading portraitist, Rembrandt Peale. In 1905 a veteran Pennsylvania journalist and politician, Alexander Kelly McClure, recalled Levin as one of the shrewdest and most persuasive politicians of the period:\n\nA brilliant adventurer named Lewis C. Levin, a native of Charleston, S.C., and a peripatetic law practitioner, first in South Carolina, next in Maryland, next in Louisiana, next in Kentucky and finally in Pennsylvania, was the acknowledged leader of the Native American element that had erupted during the summer of 1844 in what is remembered as the disgraceful riots of that year in which Catholic churches and institutions were burnt by the mob... He was one of the most brilliant and unscrupulous orators I have ever heard. He presented a fine appearance, graceful in every action charming in rhetoric and utterly reckless in assertion. I have heard him both as a temperance and political orator, and I doubt whether during his day any person in either party of the State surpassed him on the hustings. He was elected by a good majority and was re-elected in 1846 and '48, thus serving six consecutive years as a representative from the city. (Old Time Notes of Pennsylvania, 1905, pp. 84-85.)\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis Charles Levin was born in Charleston, South Carolina and graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1828. After teaching for a time he practiced law in several states for a time. He settled in Philadelphia and edited the Philadelphia Daily Sun for a time. In that capacity he was arrested for exciting to riot and treason in inciting locals against a Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nHe was a member of the American Party (Know Nothing Party) platform and is sometimes credited as one of the party's founders. He entered Congress on its platform in 1844. Once in office he argued in favor of prayer in the public schools and against immigration. His role in a Nativist party is sometimes deemed a paradox. However, unlike Judah P. Benjamin or David Levy Yulee, he was born in the United States. Levin was elected as a candidate of the American Party to the Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-first Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Engraving during the Thirtieth Congress. He lost reelection in 1850 and returned to teaching.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{BB358D3A-19A0-4FC2-BF90-B04F819E7EE9}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00893","objects_customfield_6":"UNIVERSAL JEWISH ENCYCLOPEDIA","objects_customfield_5":"LEVIN, LEWIS CHARLES (1808-1860)","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"4/7/1846","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Govt.

An early attempt, after the close of the Mexican War and just before Zachary Taylor's inauguration, to organize the South with a single pro-slavery voice. Drafted initially by John C. Calhoun, the Address was deemed by some southern congressman too drastic [Potter] and modified accordingly. As finally issued, it stands as an articulate and dignified assertion of the South's complaint that the North had breached the original constitutional bargain to protect the institution of slavery. But it was signed by only 48 of the 121 southern congressmen, hopes of unity shattered by Southern Whigs, who rejected the Address because their incoming President, a Louisiana slave-holding Whig, was expected to resolve in the South's favor the divisive issues arising from the Mexican Cession. Never were predictions more inaccurate, for Taylor would bluntly advocate immediate statehood for California and New Mexico, which would have resulted in anti-slavery constitutions for those States.

LETTER from the HON. ROBERT J. WALKER; SPEECH ON MAINTAINING THE UNION AND PRO.SOUTHERN RIGHTS; SENT & ASD AS A FREE FRANK BY.... D.L. YULEE US SENATE.\n\n\n\nImportant pro-Slavery document published five years before the Civil War began. The document is a 16-page pamphlet titled An Appeal for the Union, by the Hon. Robert J. Walker. \n\n\n\nThe pamphlet that Yulee signed was written by Robert J. Walker (1801-1869) and published in 1856. Walker had been a United States Senator from Mississippi from 1835 to 1846 and Secretary of the Treasury from 1845 to 1849 (and the following year would be appointed as the fourth Territorial Governor of Kansas by President Buchanan). In this pamphlet, he supports Buchanan against the radical Republicans, whom he paints as actually being anti-union, a party whose platform exposes the Union to imminent peril. An ardent expansionist, Walker urges the election of Buchanan, running against Fremont, the candidate of the new Republican Party. The election of Buchanan, he holds, is the only way to preserve the Union.\n\n\n\nBut even more important than the document it is the autograph of the U.S. Senator who signed it (for the postage-free franking privilege enjoyed by members of Congress) and who addressed it in his own hand! \n\n\n\nThe man who signed it was Senator David Levy Yulee of Florida, in whose honor both the town of Yulee and Levy County in Florida were named. He was the first Jewish member of the U.S. Senate in history, the Father of Florida's Railroads, and a secessionist whose plantation was burned by Union troops during the Civil War.\n\n\n\n This document was addressed and mailed to Charles Augustus Davis, an important New York merchant and bank official. \n\n\n\nDavid Levy Yulee (1810-1886) had been born David Levy in St. Thomas, West Indies, and as a young boy was sent to school in Virginia. After studying law in St. Augustine, Florida, he was admitted to the bar in 1836 and practiced law in St. Augustine. When Florida was admitted to statehood in 1845, he was elected (as a Democrat) as one of Florida's first two United States Senators and served from 1845 to 1851. At his request, an act of the Florida Legislature changed his name to David Levy Yulee in 1846. He returned to the United States Senate in 1855 and, as tensions increased between Northern and Southern states, Yulee was a champion of states rights and looked upon secession favorably when given no acceptable alternatives. When Florida seceded from the Union, Yulee led the Southern walkout from the Senate. At the end of the War, because of his support for the Confederacy, Yulee was imprisoned at Fort Pulaski in 1865, and pardoned a year later. \n\n\n\nWhether or not Yulee was truly pro-slavery is a somewhat controversial subject, but he did own several plantations and was one of the first growers in Florida to grow sweet oranges budded from sour orange stock. However, he is even better remembered for his development of railroads in Florida. His Florida Railroad was chartered in 1853 and linked deep-water ports on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Florida. It was completed in 1861, just weeks before the Civil War began.\n\n \n\nThe last two decades of Yulee's life were devoted to rebuilding the Florida railroad system, serving as the president of several railroad companies and earning for himself the title of Father of Florida's Railroads. \n\n\n\n","thing_uuid":"{92F27823-EAF3-4290-A97C-6C1681878A58}","objects_refno":"2009.01.05.00001","objects_customfield_6":"2009.01.05.00001","objects_customfield_5":"YULEE, DAVID LEVY (1810.1886)","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"9/30/1856","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Govt.

To Miss Lilly Arden, Putnam Co., New York.\n\n\n\nThis is an important speech from a pro-Union/Southern Rights Senator from Louisiana. Additionally it is rare to find free frank signatures by Senator Yulee. He no doubt held his fellow Southern Senator in high regard.\n\n\n\nRobert J. Walker was born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1819 at the top of his class at the University of Pennsylvania and was admitted to the bar in Pittsburgh in 1821. He practiced law in Pittsburgh from 1822 until 1826 when he moved to Mississippi. There he joined his brother, Duncan Walker, in a lucrative law practice. Walker became a speculator in cotton, land and slaves. He became politically prominent during the nullification crisis, and from 1836 to 1845 he sat in the United States Senate as a Unionist Democrat. Being an ardent expansionist, he voted for the recognition of the Republic of Texas in 1837 and for the joint annexation resolution of 1845, and advocated the nomination and election of James K. Polk in 1844. \n\n\n\nHe was U.S. Secretary of the Treasury throughout the Polk administration, from March 8, 1845 until March 5, 1849, and was an influential member of the President's Cabinet. As Treasury Secretary, Walker financed the Mexican-American War and drafted the 1849 bill to establish the United States Department of the Interior. He also supported the independent Treasury system, pushed for a tariff for revenue, and established a warehousing system for handling imports that has had lasting influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalker at first opposed the Compromise of 1850, but was won over later by the arguments of Stephen A. Douglas. He was appointed governor of Kansas Territory in the spring of 1857 by President James Buchanan, but resigned within the year because of his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution. In a resignation letter to Secretary of State Lewis Cass dated December 15, 1857, he cited clear voting fraud and improper political pressure from the Administration\n\n\n\nHe supported the Union cause during the American Civil War and in 1863 and 1864, as financial agent of the United States, did much to create confidence in Europe in the financial resources of the United States. During this time Walker was instrumental in securing a loan of $250,000,000 from Germany.\n\n","thing_uuid":"{CAD17BA6-185F-4287-B420-4587D756F3F0}","objects_refno":"2006.12.26.00898","objects_customfield_6":"2006.12.26.00898","objects_customfield_5":"YULEE, DAVID LEVY (1810.1886)","objects_objtype":"PAMPHLET","objects_date":"9/30/1856","objects_coltype":"BOOKS..Govt.
