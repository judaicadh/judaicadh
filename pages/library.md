[Penn Libraries](https://www.library.upenn.edu/) is a diverse community striving for inclusive excellence, and pursue the libraries mission to partner with communities at Penn and beyond to produce, preserve, and provide access to knowledge. Together we build dynamic resources, tools, and expertise that inspire critical inquiry and creative expression.

We frequently collaborate with and rely on our colleagues throughout our Library. Some of these folks don't work directly with students, staff, or faculty outside the Library, but they're critical to everything we do.
