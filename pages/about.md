## What is Judaica DH?
Judaica Digital Humanities at the [Penn Libraries](http://library.upenn.edu) (also referred to as Judaica DH) is a robust program of projects and tools for experimental digital scholarship with Judaica collections, informed by digital humanities, Jewish studies, and cultural heritage approaches. 

## How can Judaica DH fit into my work? What do you do?
* We pursue short-term digital scholarship projects related to Penn's Judaica collections.
* Along with our partners in the [Kislak Center](https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak/about), we foster innovative approaches to integrating material and digital research and advocating for open data.
* As part of the [Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship](https://guides.library.upenn.edu/digital-scholarship), we support new scholarly creation through data curation and management; develop and engage with new methods for digital research projects, including the digital humanities; and explore new publishing models, especially open access publishing.
* Check out our current and legacy projects [here](/projects).

## Can we work together on a project?
We love to team up with other folks at Penn and beyond! Our decisions about longer-term research collaboration are based on the resources, skills, and interests/mission of all parties. Please [contact us](mailto:judaicadh@gmail.com) for an initial consult to discuss ideas.

## How does Judaica DH fit into Penn Libraries?
JudaicaDH was formally founded in 2016, thanks to a gift from the Gershwind-Bennett families. We're part of [Penn Libraries](http://library.upenn.edu) and its mission to provide high-quality information resources and push the frontiers of innovation and enterprise to impact teaching, learning and research. 

Organizationally, we sit in the Library's Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship unit led by AUL [Nicky Agate](https://people/nicky-agate). Our project team members often include Library colleagues from Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts; Learning Design; Library Technology Services & Strategic Initiatives, and subject liaison librarians. We're also part of the digital humanities ecosystem of teams and people doing digital scholarship work at Penn.

## How do I contact you?
For general inquiries, write to [judaicadh@gmail.com](mailto:judaicadh@gmail.com).

We are also on Twitter at <a hfef="https://twitter.com/judaicadh">@judaicadh</a>.

## How was this website made?
This website contains the collective effort of our [team](/people), past and present. It is a Jekyll site, and site code can be found on our [GitHub repository](github.com/judaicadh/judaicadh.github.io). We forked the site design of this website from the [Scholar's Lab at the University of Virginia](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu).

## How did Judaica DH at Penn Libraries begin?
Our work as an initiative started in 2016 thanks to a generous start-up term gift from the Gershwind-Bennett Families and continues thanks to a major endowment established by Arnold and Deanne Kaplan. But Penn Libraries has been doing work in this area for a long time! View our [history](/history) page.
