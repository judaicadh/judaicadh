Building on a [exhibition of early photographs of the Holy Land](http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/LenkinHolyLandPhotos/), Laura Eckstein, the inaugural Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at Penn’s Judaica DH lab, experimented with a Python script in order to find a way to use facial recognition to comb a corpus of more than 5,000 images to bring to life the otherwise lost individual faces found in these photos. These photos were used in the [Image Gallery](http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/LenkinHolyLandPhotos/) for the exhibition. After compiling, editing, and transforming these faces into a rotating slide show, Eckstein then created a [“how-to” manual in video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKcOY5z6EP0) to show anyone interested in this tool how use the python script she created and extract the faces from their own collections of photographs.
