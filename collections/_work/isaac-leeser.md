The first Jesselson-Kaplan American Genizah project initiative took as its subject the dispersed corpus of Isaac Leeser's correspondence, the entire run of the Occident, and his publications. Thanks to a start-up grant from the Gershwind-Bennett Families, we began transcribing and scanning the correspondence, ultimately creating the [Gershwind-Bennett Isaac Leeser Digital Repository](http://leeser.library.upenn.edu/ilproject.php).
