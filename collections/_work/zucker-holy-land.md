The Zucker Holy Land Travel Manuscript takes us on a tour through the Holy Land as it was known, geographically understood at the end of the 17th century.
It describes many sites of Biblical significance, starting with Damascus and ending with the grave of Mary. The author of this German manuscript was equally interested in the Holy Land’s geography and cartography; flora and fauna; history; ethnicities; economy; and languages. In these pages, we can read in detail about the appearance of cedar trees, learn that a physician was 'swallowed and devoured' ('eingeschlucket und verschlungen') by a crocodile in the Jordan River, and hear about an unknown—to the author—animal living in the woods on Mount Tabor—to cite just a few examples. - Anna Baechtold
