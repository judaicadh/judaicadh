In 1990, **Robert Singerman** published, in conjunction with Greenwood Press, his magisterial two-volume *Judaica Americana*, an American Jewish bibliography of publications, both monographic and periodical, published prior to the 20th century. It identifies 6,500+ publications, including their metadata and names of collections where copies are known to be held. Taken as a whole, it provides extensive documentation of American Jewish communal activity. All of the publications included in JA are now in the public domain, and many have been digitized by their respective libraries for repositories such as HathiTrust, GoogleBooks, Internet Archive, or other digital copies. 

This project is a digital second edition of Judaica Americana incorporating the foundation bibliography with the approximately 3,000 supplements the author/compiler Robert Singerman has found, taking into account and removing entries that he has withdrawn from the foundation bibliography, with an explanation for why they were removed. This digital copy is available as a [file](https://repository.upenn.edu/judaica_americana/1), [dataset](https://repository.upenn.edu/judaica_americana/2), and [searchable database](https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/). Through JA2, we provide researchers, book trade specialists, genealogists, and bibliographers with the information they need to mine this invaluable resource. This project offers an example to Penn Libraries and others of how to build an open-source open-access digital library for similar materials."

We released *Judaica Americana* as a PDF and dataset on ScholarlyCommons, which you can view [here](https://repository.upenn.edu/judaica_americana/).
