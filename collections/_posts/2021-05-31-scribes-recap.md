The Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship at University of Pennsylvania Libraries, The Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University Library, the Princeton Geniza Lab, and the Zooniverse present a series of conversations on project management and development, creation and use of data, and crowdsourcing platforms and research possibilities.

[Scribes of the Cairo Geniza](https://www.scribesofthecairogeniza.org/) is a multilingual crowdsourcing project launched in 2017 to classify and transcribe manuscript fragments from a medieval Egyptian synagogue. An initiative led by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries and Zooniverse, the project harnesses the power of technology and people to decipher some of the most challenging fragments in the world.

Building on the project’s work, this series of roundtable discussions explore methods for project development and management, data curation and use, and crowdsourcing experiences in conversation with historians, developers, librarians, philologists, curators, DH practitioners, Geniza specialists, and community members around the world. We hope to engage the field at-large in a community-building exercise to reflect on our project and its connections to other crowdsourcing efforts.

This event was part of the 2020–21 “Collections as Data” series presented by the Center for Digital Humanities and Princeton University Library. Now in its third year, the series was dedicated to exploring how library, archive, and museum collections can be leveraged to support data-driven scholarship and discovery. This year’s focus is community, exploring how communities can engage with and form around data-based projects.
