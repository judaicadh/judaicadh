> In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments. You can read an overview of our Talk boards tags in the [Sorting Phase Data review](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/reviewing-sorting-phase-data-talk-board-tags-d0c0b90dc43c).

Angel names have been typically tagged on amulets or magical texts. The presence of angel names in Geniza fragments is fairly common — 37 subjects have been tagged with the term or variations of it.

One volunteer tagged the figure on the left as an **#angel**— others thought it looked more demonic than angelic!

Secular poetry is written on the verso, but the recto of this fragment features **#angel_name**.

Destinies? Drawing? Researchers aren't sure what to make of this fragment, thought one volunteer tagged the arranged dots and dashes as **#angelicalphabet**.
