Happy
[\#DayOfDH2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DayOfDH2020&src=typed_query)! This annual event brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, what we’re working on, and the rhythm of our life during DH.

Last week, [we shared some of our current and legacy projects](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/roundup-judaicadh-projects-at-penn-libraries-6ac3cfdf6a4b?source=---------4------------------) from JudaicaDH at the Penn Libraries. This week, we want to share some great work happening in the \#DHJewish field at large. First and foremost, h/t to Michelle Chesner for the [\#DHJewish](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dhjewish&src=typeahead_click) hashtag! She started aggregating sites as \#DHJewish which culminated in a 2017 article for *Judaica Librarianship*, “[JS/DH: An Introduction to Jewish Studies/ Digital Humanities Resources](https://ajlpublishing.org/index.php/jl/article/view/513).”

Haifa University hosted a floating meetup on Digital Jewish Studies early in the day, featuring presentations on the DiJeSt project, topic modeling the Eichmann trial, The Prenumerantean Project, a visualization tool for annotated (poetic) text, and more on DH pedagogy.

### Mapping Projects

[**Entering Cartographies: Meditations on Travel**](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=eef83fa346ea459facacf7ee2a37ff50) is a digital mapping project centered on Marjorie Agosín’s *Cartographies: Meditations on Travel* (2004), and stems from larger questions posed by the Venice Ghetto Working Group at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The StoryMap Journal tackles space and memory to think through themes of exile, displacement, national belonging, and exclusion.

From a multidisciplinary team at the University of Michigan, [**Mapping Modern Jewish Cultures**](https://mapping.judaic.lsa.umich.edu/) helps users examine the confluence between cafés, the urban environment, and the creativity of multilingual Jewish communities. Explore all cafés or consider how culture traveled between urban centers like Vienna, Odessa, Warsaw, Berlin, Tel Aviv and New York City.

[**Mapping Jewish Charleston**](https://mappingjewishcharleston.cofc.edu/) at the Special Collections of College of Charleston Libraries explores the Jewish presence in the city over three centuries using images and texts from their archives.

This tool from **HaMapah** features Hebrew-character place names and corresponding Latin-character name and location. Elli Fischer [mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Adderabbi/status/1255509660892872709) that the tool will have a massive update in the next few weeks, with c. 8,000 additional place name variants. Check it out on the [HaMapah blog](https://blog.hamapah.org/searchable-map-of-hebrew-place-names/).

### Manuscripts

[**Tikkoun Sofrim**](http://tikkoun-sofrim.haifa.ac.il/) (@ElijahLab) is a joint French Israeli project aimed at making Medieval Hebrew manuscripts openly and freely available as texts. In its first stage, the team is training computer algorithms to recognize handwritten text by crowdsourcing transcription.

You probably already know about [**Sefaria**](https://www.sefaria.org/texts), but did you know you can [export structured Jewish texts and metadata](https://t.co/pZGH2yO3Hy?amp=1) with free public licenses from their database?

[Footprints: Jewish Books Through Time and Place](https://footprints.ctl.columbia.edu/)([@footprints\_heb](http://twitter.com/footprints_heb "Twitter profile for @footprints_heb"))
is a projected hosted by Columbia University Libraries and co-directed
by Adam Shear, Joshua Teplitsky, Michelle Chesner, and Marjorie Lehman.
This database traces the history and movement of Jewish books since the
inception of print.

### Museums

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has produced many digital projects, including

-   The [**History Unfolded**](https://newspapers.ushmm.org) project, which asks students, teachers, and history buffs throughout the United States what was possible for Americans to have known about the Holocaust as it was happening and how Americans responded.
-   Their [digital humanities associate fellow](https://medium.com/memory-action/new-connections-to-holocaust-history-23d423537e25) worked on a data visualization mapping American newspaper coverage from History Unfolded, as well as other projects applying digital tools to Holocaust research.

**The Jewish Museum** has many cool digital resources, but their [audio tours](https://tours.thejewishmuseum.org/) are fantastic. (They were recently nominated for a Webby award!)

[**Stitching History from the Holocaust**](https://t.co/RFg9adOJPj?amp=1) is a cool collaboration bringing together the UW-Milwaukee Libraries, the UW-Milwaukee Digital Humanities Lab, and the Jewish Museum Milwaukee for an exhibit on designer Hedy Strnad.
