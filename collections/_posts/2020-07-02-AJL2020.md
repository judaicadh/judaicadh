My name is Emily Esten, and I am the Judaica Digital Humanities Project Coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries

Since 2016, the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Libraries has developed a program of research and development to augment and transform the ways in which to explore Jewish Studies. Penn Libraries has a mission to foster innovative approaches to integrating material and digital research, while advocating for open data. This program, known informally as Judaica DH, experiments with platforms, tools, and methodologies to deepen our understanding of Jewish history, texts, and cultures.

Judaica DH incorporates principles of technology, Jewish identity, diasporic connections, and collaboration in all facets of our work. As our projects bring together dispersed communities and materials, we think critically about how best to represent diverse facets of Jewish diasporic history, culture, and thought online. You can view a summary of all our projects on our [blog](). Today, I want to give you all a sense of how we structure our project process and interests.

Through initiative-based works like The Jesselson-Kaplan American Genizah Project, we have integrated digital technologies into the way we study early American Jewry by creating open access digital repositories. Through projects like Bibliotheca Hebraica Atlantica and the Digital Second Edition of Robert Singermanâ€™s Judaica Americana, facilitated the creation and creative re-use of bibliographic datasets for documenting research, activity, and culture of American Jewish communities. And through public humanities partnerships such as Scribes of the Cairo Geniza, we bring together researchers, institutions, and citizen scientists around the globe to create a new, virtual community around historic manuscript fragments, recording their own experiences along the way. These projects highlight the variety of ways that our principles facilitate instruction and content of Jewish Studies on an international level while engaging with digital humanities tools and technologies for experimentation.
