_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

**@citsci-rancho**: The classmark provides a lot of information on this fragment, written by the scribe Isaac b. Mivhar in 1240 CE. The text is [#maimonides](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/maimonides) .
