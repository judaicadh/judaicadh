> In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments. You can read an overview of our Talk boards tags in the [Sorting Phase Data review](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/reviewing-sorting-phase-data-talk-board-tags-d0c0b90dc43c).

[**Passover**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/passover)is one of the most widely celebrated Jewish holidays, commemorating the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The name comes from the Hebrew _Pesach_("to pass over"), referring to when G-d passed over the Jewish homes during the final of the Ten Plagues of Egypt. It begins on the 15th day of the Hebrew month Nisan, and lasts for seven or eight days. (In 2020, that means it begins at sundown on April 8 and ends Thursday evening on April 16.)

Most people associate Passover with the Seder, the ritual feast that marks the beginning of Passover. It's usually celebrated at home with family, friends, and community members. The [**haggadah**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/search?query=Haggadah) is the book used during the Seder on Passover, retelling the story of the Exodus from Egypt. There are many options for a haggadah, varying in commentary, illustrations and translations.

In 2018, we used the power of the crowd to create a Haggadah out of fragments from the Cairo Geniza. This patchwork haggadah invites people to look critically at the texts that they use on the holiday. You can check it out on [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/105137?lang=bi)! Combining fragments tagged by volunteers, we ordered the fragments according to their place in the seder. You can read more about that process in [an earlier blog post](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/sederscribes-1866981146e6). You'll notice that the text may differ from modern Hebrew, and that some of the fragments are written in Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Persian, and other languages!

After candles are lit and everyone is seated at the table, the Passover Seder can begin. The first step, [**Kadesh**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/kadesh), is when the attendees recite the Kiddush.

[**Urchatz**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/urchatz) is when attendees wash their hands in preparation. [**Karpas**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/karpas) is the dipping of a vegetable into salt water, symbolizing the tears the Jews shed during their servitude.
[Subject 11596834](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/11596834): ENA 2150.34, Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary [Subject 12502537](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/12502537): ENA 2434.2, Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary

During Passover, one cannot eat _chametz_ (leaven bread) and instead eats _matzot_ (unleavened flatbread). Three matzot are stacked in the middle of the Seder table. When the Seder Leader calls out " **Yachatz**", the three matzot are taken out, shown to all, and the middle piece broken in half to be hid until later.

During the [**Magid**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/magid), the story of the Exodus from Egypt is read aloud. This section is also known for the Four Questions and Four Sons, explaining why these traditions are upheld to this day.

During [**Rachtzah**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/rachtzah), attendees once again wash hands for a ceremonial cleansing, while reciting the traditional blessing.

During **Motzie**, the blessing for the matzot is recited, followed by the **Matzah,**a second blessing and the eating of a small piece of the bottom matzoh. Next is the [**Maror**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/maror), where the bitter herbs are eaten to remember the affliction of the Jewish people from sorrow, persecution, and suffering of life in bondage. And in [**Korech**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/korech), the dipped maror and matzoh are combined in a sandwich.

Finally, it's time to eat during **Shulchan Orech!**The meal customarily starts with a hard boiled egg dipped in salt water, a sign of mourning. Eating isn't officially done until [**Tzafun**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/tzafun), where the broken matzah from Yachatz returns to the table to be eaten by all the participants.

Next is **Bareich**, the grace after meals is recited — the Birkat Hamazon. The cup of Elijah (and sometimes Miriam) is set out for his arrival. During [**Hallel**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/hallel), the remainder of the Psalms of Praise are read aloud.

In the conclusion of the Seder, the leader calls out [**Nirtzah**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/nirtzah) — next year in Jerusalem! Attendees sing songs and enjoy each other's company. The last song of the night for many is "Chad Gad Yah", popular with children for its simplicty. We've written before about the fragment below as part of our [#TalkingTheTalk](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/talking-the-talk-chad-gad-yah-d1ce7abadf0a) series!
