Welcome to #DHJewish: Sharing Judaica with the Internet and Beyond! I'm going to talk for a bit about building digital projects for Jewish and non-Jewish audiences, and efforts to connect w/ offline community.

2. I'm Emily Esten, the @judaicadh coordinator at @upennlib. I manage the collaboration between digital scholarship & special collections depts. to integrate digital technologies into the ways we study Jewish history. #NCPH2020 #s36 [https://judaicadh.github.io/](https://judaicadh.github.io/)

3. Part of my efforts since starting this position has been bringing a public history lens to @judaicadh. Specifically, I'm interested in how to bridge the various communities our projects attract (Jewish/not, academic/not, online/not) and Penn's materials. #NCPH2020 #s36

4. Our largest project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza (scribesofthecairogeniza.org), is a multilingual crowdsourcing project on @the_zooniverse to classify and transcribe fragments of medieval and premodern manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza. #NCPH2020 #s36

5. We DON'T presume basic knowledge of Hebrew, Jewish history, or manuscripts. The vast majority of volunteers are NOT Jewish. (Anecdotally, people who follow along via social media usually are.) Check out our community demographics here: [https://medium.com/@judaicadh/who-are-the-genizascribes-5b58915227a6](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/who-are-the-genizascribes-5b58915227a6) #NCPH2020 #s36

6. This ends up with a lot of exciting conversations on the Talk boards, w/ volunteers who can share knowledge talking with those who do not. Read this convo about a ketubah (marriage contract) & the practice of marrying before Passover.

7. We've also started working on more in-person events outside the university, bringing in community members to engage with library materials online. #NCPH2020 #s36 [https://njjewishnews.timesofisrael.com/pitching-in-to-unlock-mysteries-of-cairo-geniza/](https://njjewishnews.timesofisrael.com/pitching-in-to-unlock-mysteries-of-cairo-geniza/)

8. Earlier this year, I worked with the children & adult learning programs at a local temple, talking about the project in conversation with crowdsourcing & Jewish history. Working with kids who read Hebrew characters has been SO rewarding! #NCPH2020 #s36 [https://www.library.upenn.edu/blogs/libraries-news/probing-time-capsule-cairo-geniza-adath-israel-synagogue](https://www.library.upenn.edu/blogs/libraries-news/probing-time-capsule-cairo-geniza-adath-israel-synagogue)

9. It's easy to think about this type of engagement with a crowdsourcing project — there are built-in opportunities for participation and involvement! How can we generate similar connections with digital repositories and exhibits that we're building? #NCPH2020 #s36

10. In what ways can we do this that engage with the existing #dhjewish & online Jewish communities that look for/use these resources? And what ways can we support the offline transition for disseminating these projects? #NCPH2020 #s36

11. & finally, one of the things we emphasize as part of @judaicadh is that the digital is diasporic. Bringing together Jewish history in a digital environment is so important because people & materials are dispersed. How can we best integrate that into our work? #NCPH2020 #s36

12. As our program grows in collections and conversation, I hope @judaicadh grows into a space that centers participation with Jewish communities on & offline. #NCPH2020 #s36 [https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/gifts-arnold-and-deanne-kaplan-penn-libraries-enrich-judaic-scholarship-and-digital-humanities](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/gifts-arnold-and-deanne-kaplan-penn-libraries-enrich-judaic-scholarship-and-digital-humanities)

13. OK, any questions? & check out my fellow #NCPH2020 #s36 panelists at @charliehersh, and @TheOtherRBG for more content!
