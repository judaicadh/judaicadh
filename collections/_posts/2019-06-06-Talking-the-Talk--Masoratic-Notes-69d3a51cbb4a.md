pull-quote: "What's the purpose of a Masoratic note? Why would one be on this fragment?  In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza."

> In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,[Scribes of the Cairo Geniza](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza). Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes! Subject 30752457: G 36â€“1, G 36â€“2, The University of Manchester Library

**@stefriegel**: small [#diagram](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/diagram) in [#margin](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/margin)

**@citsci-rancho**: [@veredrk](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/veredrk) is this "diagram" an example of a [#masora](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/masora)note?

**@stefriegel**: Ah, good to know we have a name for it.

Researcher: I'm not sure what does it signal, since this is not a masoratic text in in basic formâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIt includes [#judeo-arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/judeo-arabic) [#translation](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/translation) of Jeremiah 23, along with the Hebrew opening words of every verse.A Masoratic note should include some information concerning the textâ€Šâ€”â€Šusually a different version of spelling or pronouncingâ€Šâ€”â€Šand here, It doesn't seems so.<br>

**@citsci-rancho:** Many thanks for information about this text, [@veredrk](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/veredrk)Â . I thought this [#margin](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/margin) [#drawing](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/drawing) looked something like the one which you explained on subject 30742199 but from what you say, this drawing is not a Masoratic note. It doesn't look like a casual [#doodle](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/doodle) though. I wonder why it's there?

**@ev111**: Let me explain what i understood from this commentÂ :<br>
This is absolutely a [#massorah_note](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/massorah_note)Â , butÂ , the text is wrongÂ !<br>
A Messorah note is something you write next to the parts of the bible that are read outloudÂ , in publicÂ , on Shabbat and holidays, butÂ , these verses are not part of this "public" textÂ . I found out what it meansÂ , i'll write a separate comment about itÂ .

**@ev111**: backgroundÂ : The bible is divided into 3 partsÂ :<br>
Torah (pentateuch)Â , Nevi'im (prophets)Â , Ktuvim (Writings)Â .<br>
Every Shabbat / holidayÂ , a part of the TorahÂ , called Pa-ra-shaÂ ,<br>
is read aloud in publicÂ , soÂ , over a yearÂ , the whole Torah is readÂ ,<br>
and thenÂ , the cycle starts again. This is now daysÂ , butÂ , the Cairo Genizah show evidences that a similar cycles existed for the Nevi'im and KtuvimÂ .<br>
According to professor Yosef Ofer (Bible DepartmentÂ , Bar Ilan UniversityÂ , Israel), this symbol on our scribe is probably one of these evidencesÂ ,<br>
telling us this is the point where one part of reading ends. This tradition of reading Nevi'im and Ktuvim in cycles, just like the TorahÂ , is practiced no moreÂ .
