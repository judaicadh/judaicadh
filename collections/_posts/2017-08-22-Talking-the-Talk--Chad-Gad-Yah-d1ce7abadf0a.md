*In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,*[*Scribes of the Cairo Geniza*](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza)*. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights.

**@oct326:** In this fragment the script is neat and elegant, and across the top of one side there seems to be a symmetric decoration

**@js613:** Nice! It’s a translation of the [Chad gadya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Gadya), an [\#aramaic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/aramaic) [\#piyyut](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/piyyut) that closes the [\#passoverhagadah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/passoverhagadah) . I think it might be [\#Ladino](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Ladino) , based on the words “be-do tsad dinari” as a translation of the two zuzim.

[**Judaica DH at the Penn Libraries**](https://medium.com/u/bd8038710db5)**:**Idk about the [\#ladino](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ladino), but this is from a set of pages where the animals, like the goats, from the song Chad Gadya are illustrated in the marginalia.

**@noamsienna:** Definitely not [\#Ladino](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Ladino), but rather some dialect of [\#Judeo-persian](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Judeo-persian) or related language.

**@js613:** Yes, I based my guess on the use of the words “do” and “dinero”, which I thought were mostly used in romance languages (since the latter comes from Latin), but maybe they were also used in others? [\#asktheexperts](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/asktheexperts)

**@noamsienna:**It was a good guess! But the word “dinar” is common throughout the Islamic world… The word “tafsir” for “vernacular translation” comes from Arabic but is very commonly used in Judeo-Persian. In fact I did some searching and it seems this page isn’t even handwritten, but rather [\#printed](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/printed) via lithograph, probably in Baghdad or Mumbai in the 19th-century — the exact page also appears in the Genizah collection at the Bodleian Library: [http://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/manuscript/53f347fc-76b1-4350-8de1-e1bcf030ecba](http://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/manuscript/53f347fc-76b1-4350-8de1-e1bcf030ecba). If anyone can find the following manuscript online, I suspect it’s probably the same as well: JTS MS 1403, ENA 88 T 31 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TgoSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA371](https://books.google.com/books?id=TgoSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA371)).

**@js613:** Excellent, [@noamsienna](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/noamsienna), thank you!
