*In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,*[*Scribes of the Cairo Geniza*](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza)*. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation \#genizascribes!*

**@webpossible**: This looks like some kind of a map. Text is placed as if the shapes of different areas are being drawn. It’s a fragment of something much bigger

**@citsci-rancho**: The Library note describes this as a [\#kabbalistic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/kabbalistic) text, in which verses of [\#psalm](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/psalm) 67 are surrounded by [\#micrographic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/micrographic) script in the form of a [\#menorah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/menorah) . @researchers any comments?

**@MosheLavee**: Such “posters” are very common in synagogues of Eastern origins to the current day. See: [https://www.google.co.il/search?q=מנורה+תהילים+סז&rlz=1C1EKKP\_enIL822IL822&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQs-31x\_ngAhVSYlAKHYqoBMwQ\_AUIDigB&biw=1422&bih=678](https://www.google.co.il/search?q=%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94+%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%A1%D7%96&rlz=1C1EKKP_enIL822IL822&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQs-31x_ngAhVSYlAKHYqoBMwQ_AUIDigB&biw=1422&bih=678)

**@citsci-rancho**: Wow. Thank you for the link! Very interesting to see modern versions.

**@webpossible**: I guess what we are seeing is the flames at the top of the candlesticks then, that’s very impressive. I’ld love to be lucky enough to find the fragments to complete the document.

**@StephenFox**: I agree this would have been great to see in its entirety!

**@Chavi-NY**: Sure, here’s additional information: [http://lavlor.blogspot.com/2012/03/menorah-shaped-lamnatazeach-full-post.html](http://lavlor.blogspot.com/2012/03/menorah-shaped-lamnatazeach-full-post.html)
