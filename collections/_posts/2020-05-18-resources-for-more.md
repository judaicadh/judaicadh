### Resources for Learning More about the Cairo Geniza

One of the most frequently asked questions we get on the Scribes of the Cairo Geniza talk boards is learning more about the fragments and current research happening. Our priority is to share materials that are open-access to anyone. This list is **not** meant to be definitive, exhausting, or representative of all Geniza research! Feel free to email us at <judaicadh@gmail.com> with additional resources for this list.

### Guides 

-   The [Jewish Virtual Library](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/genizah-cairo) provides an informative summary of the Cairo Geniza and survey of Geniza discoveries and research.
-   WNET New York Public Media put together [learning resources on the Cairo Geniza](https://whyy.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/sotj14.socst.world.cairogenizah/the-cairo-genizah/) to accompany Simon Schama's PBS series, *The Story of the Jews*.
-   This [guide from Johns Hopkins Sheridan Libraries](http://guides.library.jhu.edu/jewish-studies/genizah) provides a "Who's Who" in the history of Geniza collectors and scholars.

### **Articles**

-   [**Toolkit for Genizah Scholars: A Practical Guide for Neophytes**](https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:15904/datastreams/CONTENT/content)**,** compiled by Gregor Schwarb, includes introductory articles, websites, catalogues, and specific topics related to Cairo Geniza research. 
-   [**Finding a Fragment in a Pile of Geniza: A Practical Guide to Collections, Editions, and Resources**](https://www.academia.edu/38598025/Finding_a_Fragment_in_a_Pile_of_Geniza_A_Practical_Guide_to_Collections_Editions_and_Resources) by Oded Zinger complements the first toolkit by diving into the projects and editions that exist for Geniza scholars. 
-   [**"Some "Mass Produced" Scorpion-Amulets from the Cairo Genizah"**](https://books.google.com/books?id=5I8zfmwEjjUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false) by Gideon Bohak is my go-to introduction to amulets, which always capture volunteer attention. 
-   On a similar note,[**Geniza Magical Documents**](https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10835-019-09322-6.pdf) by Ortal-Paz Saar introduces Geniza magical texts and provides some guidelines for reading these documents.
-   [**Fragment of the month**](https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/taylor-schechter-genizah-research-unit/fragment-month) from the Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit at Cambridge University Library is a series of blog posts from the unit's team as well as guest researchers that dive into unique fragments. 
-   For more on our project in particular, [**Of Scribes and Scripts: Citizen Science and the Cairo Geniza**](https://repository.upenn.edu/mss_sims/vol3/iss1/9) by the inaugural Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator Laura Newman Eckstein provides a great summary of the framing of our project

### **Books** 

As a reminder, this list is **not** meant to be definitive, exhausting, or representative of all Geniza research! Rather, they address the topics that frequently come up from volunteers.
