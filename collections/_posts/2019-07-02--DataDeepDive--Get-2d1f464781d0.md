A _get_is a divorce document, which terminates a marriage and allows the couple to remarry under Jewish law. Like a ketubah, it is written from the husband to the wife, signed by witnesses, and may include specific text related to the divorcing couple. Written by an expert scribe, it would be signed in the presence of the _beit din (_Jewish court.) You can read the text of a get [here](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/557971/jewish/Text-of-the-Get.htm).
