_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

**@stefriegel**: [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math) [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math) [#math](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math). looks like my boss's excel sheets

**@ev111**: Every column is divided to paragraphs. Each paragraph starts with a line in [#hebrew](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/hebrew) that is a [#date](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/date). The dates have a gap of a weekÂ , from friday to fridayÂ . Each paragraph contains "fractions" where the Numerator is a [#name](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/name) and the denominator is an [#arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/arabic) [#numeral](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/numeral). The dates cover almost 1 yearÂ , from fridayÂ , 15 ElulÂ , Heh-Tav-Kof-Mem (about september 1780)Â ,<br>
to FridayÂ , 13 TamuzÂ , Heh-Tav-Kof-Mem-Aleph (about August 1781)Â .
Close up of one paragraph in SubjectÂ 30752329

**@stefriegel**: maybe a paylist?

**@ev111**: The numbers range from 2 to 350Â , soÂ , the C.E.O was "milking" the companyÂ :) ADDITIONÂ : i see that the second line of every week starts with the same 2 namesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠCohen & LeviÂ .That means it has to do with the people reading the Torah in public at ShabbatÂ , and their regular donations to charityÂ . These rare donations of 3-digits must have been a special occasions like a wedding or a Bar MitzvaÂ .
