_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_
[Subject 30754627](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/30754627): L 58â€“1, L 58â€“2, The University of Manchester Library

**@Pipergirl17:** What sort of artifact is this? It appears [#illuminated](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/illuminated), with snippets written inside outlines that resemble stones. [#asktheexperts](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/asktheexperts) It's beautiful, whatever it is.

**@citsci-rancho:** Is this another [#calendar](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/calendar)Â ?

**@judaicadh:** Library notes: [Image 1,](https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/ManchesterDev~95~2~119382~124360?qvq=q:L%2058%201&mi=18&trs=398) [Image 2](https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/ManchesterDev~95~2~119387~124361). Looks like another calendarâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou can see the related subject at [30754628](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/30754628). Can anyone find a date on it?

**@ev111:** The "baloon" in the upper right corner contained the year in a few different calendarsÂ , you can see the word "Shin-Nun-Tet" meaning a year in lines 4 and 5Â . Unlucky for usÂ , the year itself is not recognisableÂ .

**@citsci-rancho:** Thanks for the link to the Library notes. Since those notes mention "basic [#astronomical](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/astronomical) data" perhaps that data could help determine the date?

**@ev111:** You have an interesting ideaÂ , but i thinkÂ , not so practical. Let me explainÂ : The basic astronomical data is their prediction of the time that the moon will be seen at the first time at that month. The good idea is to find the correct astronomical info (we can get it easily from other Zooniverse projects) and compare it to the data at this calendarÂ , and the nearest data will be the year in this calendarÂ . The problem is that the inaccuracies in the predictions might be bigÂ . [@judaicadh](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/judaicadh)Â , here is an idea for a Ph.D studentÂ : collect all the calendar scribesÂ , compare the data about the Molad (moon first sight) in the calendars to a scientific list of that info in CairoÂ , and find out how accurate the jewish calendar was at these centuriesÂ .<br>
There is an important disagreement about the jewish calendar (called Mach-lo-ket Sa-ad-yaâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBen Meir" that was understood and solvedÂ , after a thousand yearsÂ , by scribes of the Cairo GenizahÂ ,<br>
maybeÂ , there is more to find out about the jewish calendarÂ .<br>

**@citsci-rancho:** Your idea is way better than my suggestion, [@ev111](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/ev111)Â ! I hope someone will undertake the project.
