Being unfamiliar with these texts, many volunteers used descriptive tags to point of visually striking features of a fragment.

These tags show volunteers engaging with the fragments in a different light, or highlighting points of interest. These tags, like **weird**, **unusual**, **interesting**, and **beautiful**, generated rich conversations with content specialists or other volunteers. It often lets researchers return to a fragment with a new perspective!

Check out the "weird-shaped parchment" of [Subject 21952982](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/21952982). According to the Genizah Research Unit at Cambridge University Library, it's a 12th-century letter to a family member, describing a sea voyage from Tripoli to Sicily (8 days with a favorable wind). It also mentions places in Italy and North Africa, before the writer travelled to Mahdiyya and on to Fustat.
