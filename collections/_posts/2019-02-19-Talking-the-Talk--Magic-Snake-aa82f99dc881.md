_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

**@noamsienna:** Wow! This is an amazing [#magical](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/magical) fragment. The symbols on the verso are a magical alphabet (you see it in [Sefer Raziel haMalakh](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Sefer_raziel_segulot.png), for example) surrounded by a serpent (ouroboros)â€Šâ€”â€Šsomething I've never seen in Jewish magical art. The recto has [#Judeo-Arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Judeo-Arabic) segulot, or instructions for making amulets for different purposes. "If you asked [...] and her partner, then draw it on a potsherd with a copper pen and smear it with oil [...] and drink from it [...] and if you wish to be loved, write it on a potsherd [...] in the fire [...]" I'll share this with Prof. Bohak to see if he has comments!
