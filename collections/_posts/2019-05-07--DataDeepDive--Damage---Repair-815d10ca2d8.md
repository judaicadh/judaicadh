"Damaged" was one of the most popular tags used in Scribes of the Cairo Geniza. How did volunteers describe this damage?  In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments."

### Damage

[**Damaged**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/damaged) was one of the most popular tags used in Scribes of the Cairo Geniza, applied on 480 fragments. It would be expected that many damaged fragments would be found in the Cairo Genizaâ€Šâ€”â€Ša geniza by definition is a receptacle intended for worn-out and damaged materials. It is also important for the libraries and archives that host these fragments to know the condition and state of their materials, in order to best preserve them for researchers and future use.

Tags like [**crinkled**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/crinkled) **(2),** [**torn**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/torn) **(58),**and **holes (77)**refer to physical damage to the fragment.

Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library, Cairo Genizah Collection; Subject 12505870: ENA 2750, Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary

[**Transfer**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/transfer) **(3)**refers to the ink rubbing off onto one fragment from another page, as seen in the fragment below.

Tags like [**discoloured**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/discoloured) **(1)**and [**faded**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/faded) **(585)**may refer to the ink or the parchment/paper on which the fragment is written. Subject 12511265 (left) was tagged as discoloured as the volunteer tried to read the page, while Subject 11618769 (right) was tagged as faded for the Hebrew script on its verso.

Ink corrosion, tagged as **ink_corrosion (64),**is a common occurrence with iron gall ink, causing the material to disintegrate. Notice how sections or lines of the text look torn.

Some volunteers were creative in their descriptions of damage to a particular fragment, with tags like **skillfuldestruction (1)**, **snowflake (1)**, and **wormeatenbutreadable (1)**.

### **Repair &Â Reuse**

Some fragments were reused for multiple purposes! Some fragments appear to have been repaired prior to their entry in the geniza. Volunteers tagged some of these fragments with **mending (1)**and **repaired (46).**In Subject11583478 (left), volunteers wondered if therepair to the parchment took place before the text was written. Subject 12506041 was tagged as #mending for its stitching in the upper right corner.

**Reuse (2)**, and **secondary_use (20)**may be identified when the the subject includes different documents, languages, scripts, handwriting, ink, and/or orientation of the text. For Subject 12509444, volunteers noted the holes as possible evidence or reuse, and a researcher suggested it may have served as a Torah scroll prior to a scribe writing a piyyut on it.

In Subject 21708034, tagged #secondary_use, the Hebrew text on the left is distinct from the Arabic text on the rightâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen the hand is dissimilar.
