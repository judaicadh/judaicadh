Happy
[\#DayOfDH2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DayOfDH2020&src=typed_query)!
This annual event brings together digital humanists from around the
world to document what they do on one day, what we’re working on, and
the rhythm of our life during DH.

Last week, [we shared some of our current and legacy
projects](https://medium.com/@judaicadh/roundup-judaicadh-projects-at-penn-libraries-6ac3cfdf6a4b?source=---------4------------------)
from JudaicaDH at the Penn Libraries. This week, we want to share some
great work happening in the \#DHJewish field at large. First and
foremost, h/t to Michelle Chesner for the
[\#DHJewish](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dhjewish&src=typeahead_click)
hashtag! She started aggregating sites as \#DHJewish which culminated in
a 2017 article for *Judaica Librarianship*, “[JS/DH: An Introduction to
Jewish Studies/ Digital Humanities
Resources](https://ajlpublishing.org/index.php/jl/article/view/513).”

* * * * *

Haifa University hosted a floating meetup on Digital Jewish Studies
early in the day, featuring presentations on the DiJeSt project, topic
modeling the Eichmann trial, The Prenumerantean Project, a visualization
tool for annotated (poetic) text, and more on DH pedagogy.

### Mapping Projects {#33c9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="33c9"}

**Entering Cartographies: Meditations on Travel**is a digital mapping
project centered on Marjorie Agosín’s *Cartographies: Meditations on
Travel* (2004), and stems from larger questions posed by the Venice
Ghetto Working Group at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The
StoryMap Journal tackles space and memory to think through themes of
exile, displacement, national belonging, and exclusion.

From a multidisciplinary team at the University of Michigan, **Mapping
Modern Jewish Cultures** helps users examine the confluence between
cafés, the urban environment, and the creativity of multilingual Jewish
communities. Explore all cafés or consider how culture traveled between
urban centers like Vienna, Odessa, Warsaw, Berlin, Tel Aviv and New York
City.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has produced many digital
projects, including

-   The [**History Unfolded**](https://newspapers.ushmm.org) project,
    which asks students, teachers, and history buffs throughout the
    United States what was possible for Americans to have known about
    the Holocaust as it was happening and how Americans responded.
-   Their [digital humanities associate
    fellow](https://medium.com/memory-action/new-connections-to-holocaust-history-23d423537e25)

    from History Unfolded, as well as other projects applying digital
    tools to Holocaust research.
