*In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,*[*Scribes of the Cairo Geniza*](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza)*. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation \#genizascribes!*

@stefriegel: [\#name\_of\_god](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/name_of_god) 3Y, 4Y

@citsci-rancho: The Library’s note, citing pages of a study published in 2002, says the language of this [\#amidah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/amidah) from Benedictions is Hebrew. Quod Yod, but not [\#targum](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/targum) in this case? @StephenFox

@StephenFox: @citsci-rancho , yes, this does appear to be an [\#amidah](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/amidah) which has 3Y on line 2 and 4Y on line 9. So, such abbreviations can definitely be found in a variety of materials, not just targums. Further I also believe that line 8 ends with B ‘ YY which I think is short for “Blessed (are) You, O LORD.” What is the mark over each of those letters? Are they all yods as well?

@citsci-rancho: Thanks very much for the additional information about abbreviations! I had no idea what to make of the end of line eight. It’s great to learn what those marks mean. I think [@stefriegel](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/stefriegel) will be interested to learn of this as well. As you know, both of us hope that a guide to the abbreviations found in the Geniza manuscripts will be available eventually. For those of us who can’t read the text, abbreviations ( some of which are easy to recognize) are often one of our best clues about the nature of the text- religious? commercial?- so we are glad to learn to recognize new ones.

@Chavi-NY: Line 8 ends with: B’ [Baruch] A’ [Atoh] and then two Yud’s for G-d’s name.

@citsci-rancho: Thanks for further explanation, Chavi! I hope to recognize this next time I see it, and even understand what it means! Do you happen to know what the marks which [@StephenFox](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/StephenFox) noted above the letters mean?

@Chavi-NY: The mark above the ב indicates it’s an abbreviation for the word ברוך (Baruch). The mark above the א indicates it’s an abbreviation for the word אתה (Atoh). The mark above the yuds are typical for G-d’s name. Some explanation [here](https://www.aish.com/atr/Two-Yuds-for-Name-of-God.html). That’s why I wrote previously: B’ [Baruch] A’ [Atoh] and then two Yud’s for G-d’s name. Line 2 also ends with Baruch Atoh and then two Yud’s for G-d’s name, but there the scribe wrote the words without abbreviation.

@citsci-rancho: Thank you! Neat comparison with line 2!

@StephenFox: [@Chavi-NY](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/Chavi-NY), at first glance, there appears to be two marks above the yods but there is only one. The other mark is the tail of the trailing kaph of “ma\`ankha” in the line above.

@Chavi-NY: True! I’ll update my comment.

@stefriegel: Thank you, @StephenFox and @Chavi-NY. With your kind permission, I’ll copy this explanation into the Glossary.

@citsci-rancho: My thanks to all for a wonderful discussion!
