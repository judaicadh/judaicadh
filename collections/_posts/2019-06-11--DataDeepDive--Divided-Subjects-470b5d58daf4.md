> In this series, we take a deep dive into the Talk boards tags to look at how volunteers classify the fragments. You can read an overview of our Talk boards tags in the Sorting Phase Data review.

In our review of the sorting phase data, we noted that most subjects were classified by 5 volunteers before they were retired & officially classified. At the start of the project, we had that number as 7 volunteers. When we changed the number from 7 to 5, any subject that had already received 5 classifications had to receive one more classification before it would be retired & formally sorted. **8 contested subjects (<1%) were affected by this change,**leaving the subject still contested after retirement.

We wanted to take a closer look at some of these subjects with context from our researchers.

While all of the volunteers who viewed this subject classified it as informal, they were split on whether it was Hebrew or Arabic. This subject will be found in the **Challenging Hebrew**workflow.
