_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

**@stefriegel**: Wow 6Y!<br>
O Lord my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majestyâ€Šâ€”â€Š<br>
who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain!

**@ev111:** Check the decorations at the end of the lines (3,12,and more)Â ,<br>
this scribbler was feeling happyÂ :)

**@citsci-rancho:** Wow, indeed! I wonder if we will find any other examples of this beautiful 6Y? Also: Thanks for pointing out the lovely [#decorations](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/decorations), [@ev111](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/ev111)Â . I was so dazzled by the 6Y 's that I might have failed to notice them.

**@ev111:** Check [here](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/1029/716283?comment=1195342&page=1)Â , image 1Â , line 1Â . This is the original source to the sentence you wroteÂ .

**@stefriegel**: YES!

**@Chavi-NY**: Looks like the decorations were added to keep the left alignment. The apostrophe is really a yud (×™) and last letter ×˜ is really the two letters (× ×•).

**@Chavi-NY**: In addition perhaps it would be more accurate to consider the 6Y as really 3Y and the top 3 symbols are decoration? The shema is a very important prayer in Judaism and extra attention usually given to the first verse, which is probably why the scribe added the extra decoration...
