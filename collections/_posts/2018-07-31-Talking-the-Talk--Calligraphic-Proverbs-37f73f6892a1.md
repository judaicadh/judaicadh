_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

**@Shir-El:** [**#fragment**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/fragment) **_eshet ha-il_, Woman of Valor; Proverbs 31? Ellegant calligraphy.**

**@noamsienna:** Fascinating, and gorgeous! This is indeed Proverbs, but not the familiar Eshet Hayyil of Prov. 31. Side 1 is from Prov. 14 (verses 13â€“16), and side 2 is from Prov. 12 (verses 2â€“5). The lines have only a word or two missing on each side, so the columns must have been quite narrow in the original. Interestingly, the style of script here is typical of medieval Ashkenaz, so this text (or the scribe) must have travelled quite far to end up in the Cairo Genizah.

**@Shir-El:** Maybe came with a bride; Ashkenazi-Sepharadi marriages were more common than once thought.
