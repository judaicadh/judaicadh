### Talking the Talk: Books {#a835 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="a835"}

*In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk
boards for our project,*[*Scribes of the Cairo
Geniza*](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza?source=post_page---------------------------)*.
Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one
another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask
questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk
conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation

MS. Heb. b. 3, Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford

**@Pipergirl17**: Fol. 35a & 35b, vol 15\
[\#hebrewscript](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/hebrewscript)
and

There are characters at the bottom of Image 2 that almost look like
Western Arabic numbers, but I can’t really make them out (sort of like
when you see something out of the corner of your eye).\
Library notes say
[\#judeo\_arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/judeo_arabic)
and some
[\#arabic](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/arabic),
and the content is “A list of books, perhaps pawned”.

**@citsci-rancho**: As
[@Pipergirl17](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/Pipergirl17) comments,
the Bodl. description of this doc says: “A list of books, perhaps
pawned” Maybe that’s why there seem to be
[\#numerals](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/numerals)
under bars on image 2?
[@judaicadh](https://www.zooniverse.org/users/judaicadh) while this doc
may be trash from a scholarly perspective, I’m dying to know what these
pawned books are! (This could be a widely-enjoyed blog post, imho) I
humbly beg an expert to translate it for the rest of us.

**@judaicadh**: Ooh, this is interesting! It looks like this has been of
scholarly interest, and I do have some sources for this from FGP as a
starting point. On FGP, there is a full transcription of the Hebrew text
on image 2 (see image). Really basic translations to English suggest
that those are numerals (paid for in dirhams) and these are
translations/interpretations of various literary texts:

Judith Olszowy-Schlanger wrote about this fragment briefly in the
article, [“Cheap Books in Medieval Egypt: Rotuli from the Cairo
Geniza”](https://www.academia.edu/38308335/Judith_Olszowy-Schlanger_Cheap_Books_in_Medieval_Egypt_Rotuli_from_the_Cairo_Geniza_Intellectual_History_of_the_Islamicate_World_vol._4_2016_82-101).
She notes many of these are short Biblical books sold as separate
units — Book of Daniel for 2 dirhams, for example. She also says:

> *In general, new books were more expensive. A book list in ms Oxford,
> Bodl. Heb. b 3. fol. 35b, first half of the twelfth century, lists
> relatively inexpensive books, mostly legal tractates or parts of the

@researchers, anything to add?

**@lmeiselman**: quite interesting. Yes this is clearly a re-seller and
I might want to add that although one can’t discern from this note of
what condition the books were in, including if the books were missing
and how much was missing, to be factored vis-à-vis the price listed
here. so, perhaps the book of Daniel was missing parts and some folios
were washed, for example, and that’s why the price was so cheap.\
Although they are very different, just thought I’d add that I processed
a manuscript of printed book re-seller in the early-modern period which
also listed books relatively cheaply. While it isn’t totally clear, one
can see that due to factors such as book popularity and market price
determined the values. Link:
