_In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project,_ [_Scribes of the Cairo Geniza_](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza) _. Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes!_

One of our moderators @noamsienna writes: " Whoa! Super cool... Seems like an decorated list of places in the Land of Israel (Shekhem, Karmel, and some smaller villages tooâ€Šâ€”â€ŠKafr Manda, Ammuqa, Yaquq, etc.) with descriptions of what to see in each placeâ€Šâ€”â€Ša kind of pilgrim's guide / map. I've seen some later examples of this kind of thing, but this looks like a fascinating and early example."
