description: The Zucker Holy Land Travel Manuscript takes us on a tour through the
  Holy Land as it was known, geographically understood at the end
  of the 17th century.<br>It describes many sites of Biblical significance, starting
  with Damascus and ending with the grave of Mary. The author of this German manuscript
  was equally interested in the Holy Land’s geography and cartography; flora and fauna;
  history; ethnicities; economy; and languages. In these pages, we can read in detail
  about the appearance of cedar trees, learn that a physician was 'swallowed and devoured'
  ('eingeschlucket und verschlungen') by a crocodile in the Jordan River, and hear
  about an unknown—to the author—animal living in the woods on Mount Tabor—to cite
  just a few examples. - Anna Baechtold
