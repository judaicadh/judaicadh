description: The presence of Latin and Greek texts as well as Hebrew Bibles in colonial
  American libraries is well documented. What lacks systematic documentation are other
  kinds of Oriental, Hebraic and rabbinic texts that shared the shelves with them.
  This project aims to explore volumes of such texts that crossed the Atlantic during
  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and were available as reading materials
  in institutional and private libraries. Though hidden in plain sight, recognition
  of these libraries of “Christian rabbinism” - that is, Christian interest in post-Biblical
  Jewish history and in comparative Semitic scholarship, and its arrival in the Western
  Hemisphere - requires a shift of attention that now has become possible thanks to
  a new generation of research on the subject. Christian learning about Judaism as
  a chapter in the early modern history of scholarship, however, has mainly focused
  on the European context. How and when this prodigious output, this first wave of
  scholarly migration, crossed the Atlantic and took root in the colonial Americas
  still remains to be framed.
