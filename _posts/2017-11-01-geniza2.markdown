description: We are the recipients of an in kind grant from the Zooniverse to transcribe
  pre-modern and medieval manuscript fragments from the Cairo Geniza. Zooniverse is
  a non-profit crowdsourcing platform that has over 1.5 million 'citizen scientists'
  who will help to work on transcribing these fragments. The in-kind grant is part
  of an approximately 1.2 million dollar IMLS grant Zooniverse was awarded and is
  dispersing over four transcription projects, two text and two audio. Over the next
  three years we will receive extensive developer time from Zooniverse to build a
  framework that not only allows for the transcription of Geniza fragments but also
  allows for the classification of these fragments into their general genre, whether
  literary (religious text), or documentary (non-religious- text), and then their
  more specific genre, as well as language and script characteristics. Students and
  the general public will have the opportunity to benefit from encountering these
  fragments online and from learning how to transcribe them as members of this citizen
  scientist community. We see this project as a way for people with shared interests
  and different skill levels from around the world to meet in a common endeavor. We
  see this as a way to develop new tools for the public to learn to read a variety
  of scribal hands and to open texts accessible only to a handful of specialists to
  millions of people.
