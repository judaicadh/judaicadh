  Jewry, at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
description: This project is an ambitious, multi-disciplinary effort that takes an
  unprecedented approach to the study of global agrarianism, particularly at the intersection
  between physical space and communities in the Jewish world. A comprehensive research
  corpus produced by this project will provide the inspiration, metadata content and
  scholarly vehicle for cutting-edge, free-access digital educational packages that
  can restructure the ways in which Jewish history is accessed by the general public.
  These digital platforms will provide exciting points of entry into that history
  from Biblical times onward for new audiences throughout the academy and general
  public, particularly young people previously unexposed or uninterested in Jewish
  history, culture or identity. It is hoped that these products can spark vibrant
  public and scholarly discourses that will contribute forcefully to current debates
  on the balance between the modern growth of the Land of Israel and historic developments
  in the communities of the diaspora.
