description: Our third Jesselson-Kaplan American Genizah Project, The Sabato Morais
  Papers, resulted in the digitization and TEI encoding of the Sabato Morais Papers.  We
  are in the process of building a searchable database that performs full-text searching
  of almost every document in the Sabato Morais Papers and displays the images of
  retrieved documents alongside their encoded transcription.  This project is of interest
  to scholars of American, Italian and Sephardic Jewish history, religious studies,
  immigration and ethnic studies, Hebrew language and the history of Biblical interpretation,
  and the history of scholarship. By making these writings and correspondence of Sabato
  Morais digitally available, researchers have access to primary sources that document
  the development of observant Jewish life in the broad context of Victorian culture
  on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century.  The Italian-born Morais
  is chiefly remembered by historians as the founder and first president of the Jewish
  Theological Seminary, established in New York City in 1886 (today the institutional
  home of the Conservative denomination of American Judaism). He also was an outspoken
  intellectual force whose public concerns, such as religious freedom, human rights,
  antislavery and the abolition of the death penalty were national and international
  in scope. After his death, Cyrus Adler, the first operating president of Dropsie
  College and one of American Jewry's most visible public figures in the early twentieth
  century, described Morais as “the representative American Jew” to his co-religionists
  of England, France, Italy, and the Orient. The New York Times remembered Morais
  as 'the most eminent rabbi in this country . . . a powerful and aggressive factor
  in discussions of vast import and interest to millions of people; a deep, incisive,
  fearless thinker, speaker, and writer.'
