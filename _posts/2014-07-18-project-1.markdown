description: Judaica DH is currently working to create an interactive mapping tool of the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica. Through this interactive mapping tool, we not only provide the locations at which objects from the collection originate, but we provide full viewing access. In addition, as part of the "interactive" component, the map will contain ways for users to filter both with temporal space, with type of object, and through merely elastic searching.
