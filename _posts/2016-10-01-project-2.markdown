description: Judaica DH, with support from our partners at the Princeton Genizah Lab
  and Rochester Institute of Technology's MAGIC Center, is working to create a game
  that will transcribe Cairo Geniza fragments. Without needing any secondary language
  proficiency, users will only need to be able to match picture to picture. For example,
  a user might match a picture of an “aleph,” written in modern Hebrew script and
  the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, to a picture of the “aleph” known to be
  written in the Cairo Geniza hand. They know what the picture of each "aleph" looks
  like, yet they don't need to know the letter is an aleph. The data from the game
  will then be exported and will be used by scholars to analyze Geniza fragments.
