description: Judaica DH is currently working to create an interactive mapping tool
  of the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica. Through this
  interactive mapping tool, we not only provide the locations at which objects from
  the collection originate, but we provide full viewing access. In addition, as part
  of the "interactive" component, the map will contain ways for users to filter both
  with temporal space, with type of object, and through merely elastic searching.
