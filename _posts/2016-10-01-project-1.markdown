description: In November of 2012, the Penn Libraries received the Arnold and Deanne
  Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica. This gift of nearly 11,000 items was
  appraised at $8.5 million. It continues to grow and currently consists of over 13,000
  items. It is the most important private collection of its kind, documenting the
  social and economic development of early Jewish life in the Western Hemisphere.
  The core of the Kaplan Collection covers the period before mass Jewish migration
  to the Americas in the late 1880s. Laura Newman Eckstein, our Judaica DH coordinator,
  is currently working to create an interactive mapping tool of the Arnold and Deanne
  Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica. Through this interactive mapping tool,
  we not only provide the locations at which objects from the collection originate,
  but we provide full viewing access. In addition, as part of the "interactive" component,
  the map will contain ways for users to filter both with temporal space, with type
  of object, and through merely elastic searching.
