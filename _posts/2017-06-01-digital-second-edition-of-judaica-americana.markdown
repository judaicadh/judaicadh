description: In 1990, Robert Singerman published, in conjunction with Greenwood Press, his magisterial two-volume Judaica Americana, an American Jewish bibliography of publications, both monographic and periodical, published prior to the 20th century. It identifies 6,500+ publications, including their metadata and names of collections where copies are known to be held.  Taken as a whole, it provides extensive documentation of American Jewish communal activity. All of the publications included in JA are now in the public domain, and many have been digitized by their respective libraries for repositories such as HathiTrust, GoogleBooks, Internet Archive, or other digital copies.  
 
This project intends to publish a digital second edition of Judaica Americana incorporating the foundation bibliography with the approximately 3,000 supplements the author/compiler Robert Singerman has found, taking into account and removing entries that he has withdrawn from the foundation bibliography, with an explanation for why they were removed. This digital copy will be available as a file, dataset, and searchable database.
 
Through JA2, we expect to provide researchers, book trade specialists, genealogists, and bibliographers with the information they will need to mine this invaluable resource. We also expect to provide an example to Penn Libraries and others of how to build an open-source open-access digital library for similar materials."
