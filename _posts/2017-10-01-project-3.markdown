description: Building on a recent exhibition of early photographs of the Holy, Laura
  Eckstein, the Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at Penn’s Judaica DH lab, experimented
  with a Python script in order to find a way to use facial recognition to comb a
  corpus of more than 5,000 images to bring to life the otherwise lost individual
  faces found in these photos. <br>  After compiling, editing, and transforming these
  faces into a rotating slide show, Laura then created a [“how-to” manual in video
  format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKcOY5z6EP0) to show anyone interested in
  this tool how use the python script she created and extract the faces from their
  own collections of photographs.
