description: The Sabato Morais Papers Digitization Project digitized and encoded in
  TEI the entire Sabato Morais Papers, which belong to the Penn Libraries and reside
  at the Katz CAJS. We created a searchable database that performed full-text searching
  of every document in the Sabato Morais Papers and displays the images of retrieved
  documents alongside their encoded transcription. </br> This project is of interest
  to scholars of American, Italian and Sephardic Jewish history, religious studies,
  immigration and ethnic studies, Hebrew language and the history of Biblical interpretation,
  and the history of scholarship.  By making these writings and correspondence of
  Sabato Morais digitally available, researchers have access to primary sources that
  document the development of observant  Jewish life in the broad context of Victorian
  culture on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century. </br> The Italian-born
  Morais is chiefly remembered by historians as the founder and first president of
  the Jewish Theological Seminary, established in New York City in 1886 (today the
  institutional home of the Conservative denomination of American Judaism).  He also
  was an outspoken intellectual force whose public concerns, such as religious freedom,
  human rights, antislavery and the abolition of the death penalty were national and
  international in scope.  After his death, Cyrus Adler, the first operating president
  of Dropsie College and one of American Jewry's most visible public figures in the
  early twentieth century, described Morais as “the representative American Jew” to
  his co-religionists of England, France, Italy, and the Orient.  The New York Times
  remembered Morais as "the most eminent rabbi in this country . . . a powerful and
  aggressive factor in discussions of vast import and interest to millions of people;
  a deep, incisive, fearless thinker, speaker, and writer."
