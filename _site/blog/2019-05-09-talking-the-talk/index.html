  <meta name="description" content="In this series we honor the contributions made on the Zooniverse Talk boards for our project, Scribes of the Cairo Geniza . Talk is a way for citizen scientists on Zooniverse to converse with one another and experts on the different material they are working on, ask questions, and explore new insights. Each week we will feature a talk conversation that we love. Thanks for the participation #genizascribes! Subject 30754627: L 58–1, L 58–2, The University of Manchester Library @Pipergirl17: What sort of artifact is this? It appears #illuminated, with snippets written inside outlines that resemble stones. #asktheexperts It’s beautiful, whatever it is. @citsci-rancho: Is this another #calendar ? @judaicadh: Library notes: Image 1, Image 2. Looks like another calendar — you can see the related subject at 30754628. Can anyone find a date on it? @ev111: The “baloon” in the upper right corner contained the year in a few different calendars , you can see the word “Shin-Nun-Tet” meaning a year in lines 4 and 5 . Unlucky for us , the year itself is not recognisable . @citsci-rancho: Thanks for the link to the Library notes. Since those notes mention “basic #astronomical data” perhaps that data could help determine the date? @ev111: You have an interesting idea , but i think , not so practical. Let me explain : The basic astronomical data is their prediction of the time that the moon will be seen at the first time at that month. The good idea is to find the correct astronomical info (we can get it easily from other Zooniverse projects) and compare it to the data at this calendar , and the nearest data will be the year in this calendar . The problem is that the inaccuracies in the predictions might be big . @judaicadh , here is an idea for a Ph.D student : collect all the calendar scribes , compare the data about the Molad (moon first sight) in the calendars to a scientific list of that info in Cairo , and find out how accurate the jewish calendar was at these centuries . There is an important disagreement about the jewish calendar (called Mach-lo-ket Sa-ad-ya — Ben Meir” that was understood and solved , after a thousand years , by scribes of the Cairo Genizah , maybe , there is more to find out about the jewish calendar . @mrustow @MosheLavee @veredrk @citsci-rancho: Your idea is way better than my suggestion, @ev111 ! I hope someone will undertake the project.
