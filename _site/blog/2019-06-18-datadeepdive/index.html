<p>Volunteers have tagged <strong>13 subjects as #medicine,</strong>using library notes and keywords from a page to make the connection to its topic. Exploring medieval medicine, history of pharmacology, and medical practice in Jewish communities, researchers and volunteers use these fragments to make connections to their own understanding of medical history. Below are three examples of #medicine subjects from the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> Talk boards.</p>

<p>Sometimes, magical texts are connected to the history of medicine. In our discussion of <a href="https://medium.com/@judaicadh/datadeepdive-charakteres-45588bd21143">charakteres</a>, we talked about recipes for aiding women having difficulty with delivering a child. This is another example cited by Gideon Bohak, using biblical verse in Jewish magic for medical assistance.

<p>Subject 12511456 is one of several Arabic texts under this shelfmark with red ink and previous writings visible. At least one volunteer noted words like “urine” and “jaundice” on this page, suggesting it may be notes from a medical book.
