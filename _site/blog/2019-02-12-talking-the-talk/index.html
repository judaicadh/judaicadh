<p><strong>@citsci-rancho:</strong> left image resembles subjects 1249 8828 and 1249 8839,<br />
but includes an Arabic seal.<br />
<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/Numerals">#Numerals</a> in the text have a horizontal bar above them. On verso two large lines of dark, elegant Arabic script divide the page diagonally.<br />
Informal script, accounting or tallies(?) and a scribble (or <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/signature">#signature</a>?) are scattered about the page.</p>

<p><strong>@dziakj1:</strong> There also appears to be <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math">#math</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seal">#seal</a> . Perhaps this is a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger">#ledger</a> ?</p>

<p><strong>@citsci-rancho:</strong> Perhaps it is a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger">#ledger</a>, or part of one. I would love to know.</p>

<p>There are at least 48 very similar subjects. Many have hashtags <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/math">#math</a>, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/ledger">#ledger</a>, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/list">#list</a> or <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/tables">#tables</a>.<br />
This subject, 12499254, is one of the two which also has a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seal">#seal</a>.<br />
Perhaps all are part of a single multi-page document?</p>

<p><strong>@js613:</strong> Agree they are all related and all some sort of ledger. This subject has on the recto two blocks of text. The top line of the top block has 7 words; words 3–6 are סדר וילך שנת התקנ”ט (The week that the portion of Vayelekh is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept. 15, 1798]). The top line of the second block of text also has 7 words; words 3–6 are ס’ האזינו שנת התקנ”ט (The week that the portion of Ha’azinu is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept 22, 1798]).</p>

<p>The verso also has two blocks of text, one on the top right corner, the other in the bottom left corner; they are bisected by a diagonal line of Arabic. The second line of the top right block of text has 4 words: ס’ [וזאת ה]ברכה ש’ התקנ”ט (The week the portion Ve-zot ha-berakhah is read in the year 5559 [week of Sept. 29, 1798]).) The first line of the bottom left block has 3 words; words 2–3 are אל כפרות (on/of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapparot">Kaparot</a>). The second line has 3 words: של ש’ התקנ”ט (of the year 5559 [1798]).</p>

<p>That’s the best I can make out. Any thoughts <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/asktheexperts">#asktheexperts</a> ?</p>

<p><strong>@citsci-rancho:</strong> Thanks so much!<br />
I’m very glad to have a clearer picture of what these pages are,<br />
and when they were written.</p>

<p>As of March 10, 2018 there are 48 subjects which appear to me to be parts of this document.<br />
33 have subject numbers between 1249 8818 and 1249 8877.<br />
14 (including two with differing <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/seals">#seals</a>), have subject numbers between 1249 9237 and 1249 9258. One is subject 1251 0233.</p>
