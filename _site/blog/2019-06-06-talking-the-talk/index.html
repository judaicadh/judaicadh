Researcher: I’m not sure what does it signal, since this is not a masoratic text in in basic form — It includes #judeo-arabic #translation of Jeremiah 23, along with the Hebrew opening words of every verse.A Masoratic note should include some information concerning the text — usually a different version of spelling or pronouncing — and here, It doesn’t seems so. #biblical @citsci-rancho: Many thanks for information about this text, @veredrk . I thought this #margin #drawing looked something like the one which you explained on subject 30742199 but from what you say, this drawing is not a Masoratic note. It doesn’t look like a casual #doodle though. I wonder why it’s there? @ev111: Let me explain what i understood from this comment : This is absolutely a #massorah_note , but , the text is wrong ! A Messorah note is something you write next to the parts of the bible that are read outloud , in public , on Shabbat and holidays, but , these verses are not part of this “public” text . I found out what it means , i’ll write a separate comment about it . @ev111: background : The bible is divided into 3 parts : Torah (pentateuch) , Nevi’im (prophets) , Ktuvim (Writings) . Every Shabbat / holiday , a part of the Torah , called Pa-ra-sha , is read aloud in public , so , over a year , the whole Torah is read , and then , the cycle starts again. This is now days , but , the Cairo Genizah show evidences that a similar cycles existed for the Nevi’im and Ktuvim . According to professor Yosef Ofer (Bible Department , Bar Ilan University , Israel), this symbol on our scribe is probably one of these evidences , telling us this is the point where one part of reading ends. This tradition of reading Nevi’im and Ktuvim in cycles, just like the Torah , is practiced no more . You can read the whole conversation here.

<p><strong>@stefriegel</strong>: small <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/diagram">#diagram</a> in <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/margin">#margin</a></p>

<p><strong>@citsci-rancho</strong>: <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/users/veredrk">@veredrk</a> is this “diagram” an example of a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/masora">#masora</a>note?</p>

<p><strong>@stefriegel</strong>: Ah, good to know we have a name for it.</p>

<p>Researcher: I’m not sure what does it signal, since this is not a masoratic text in in basic form — It includes <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/judeo-arabic">#judeo-arabic</a> <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/translation">#translation</a> of Jeremiah 23, along with the Hebrew opening words of every verse.A Masoratic note should include some information concerning the text — usually a different version of spelling or pronouncing — and here, It doesn’t seems so.<br />

<p><strong>@citsci-rancho:</strong> Many thanks for information about this text, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/users/veredrk">@veredrk</a> . I thought this <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/margin">#margin</a> <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/drawing">#drawing</a> looked something like the one which you explained on subject 30742199 but from what you say, this drawing is not a Masoratic note. It doesn’t look like a casual <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/doodle">#doodle</a> though. I wonder why it’s there?</p>

<p><strong>@ev111</strong>: Let me explain what i understood from this comment :<br />
This is absolutely a <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/massorah_note">#massorah_note</a> , but , the text is wrong !<br />
A Messorah note is something you write next to the parts of the bible that are read outloud , in public , on Shabbat and holidays, but , these verses are not part of this “public” text . I found out what it means , i’ll write a separate comment about it .</p>

<p><strong>@ev111</strong>: background : The bible is divided into 3 parts :<br />
Torah (pentateuch) , Nevi’im (prophets) , Ktuvim (Writings) .<br />
Every Shabbat / holiday , a part of the Torah , called Pa-ra-sha ,<br />
is read aloud in public , so , over a year , the whole Torah is read ,<br />
and then , the cycle starts again. This is now days , but , the Cairo Genizah show evidences that a similar cycles existed for the Nevi’im and Ktuvim .<br />
According to professor Yosef Ofer (Bible Department , Bar Ilan University , Israel), this symbol on our scribe is probably one of these evidences ,<br />
telling us this is the point where one part of reading ends. This tradition of reading Nevi’im and Ktuvim in cycles, just like the Torah , is practiced no more .</p>
