<p>A <em>piyyut</em> (also spelled <em>piyut</em>; plural: <em>piyyutim</em>) is a Jewish liturgical poem, usually designated to be sung, chanted, or recited during religious services. They were written to be performed by the leader of the service, with the congregation repeating the refrain. Piyyutim often reference midrash, biblical allusions, or rabbinic traditions. Geniza scholars have learned so much about the purpose and piyyut from collections like the Cairo Geniza.</p>

<p>So far, volunteers have tagged 95 subjects as #piyyut — below are six piyyutim found in the project.</p>

<p>Subject 21953571 includes a Yotzer piyyut for Yom Kippur by Shmuel Bar Hosha’ana. The Yotzer sequence includes blessings surrounding the morning recitation of the Shema. The author, Shmuel ben Hosha’ana, was one of the most important Hebrew liturgical poets of the tenth century.

<p>This piyyut is a <em>selihah</em>(plural: <em>selihot)</em>, or a penitential poem read leading up to the High Holy Days or on Fast Days. This piyyut is written by Sahalan ben Avraham, a liturgical poet and leader of the Iraqi congregation in Fustat from during the 11th century.

<p>This is a piyyut by Isaac Kanzi. (In doing a little research, we found another Kanzi piyyut from <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/subjects/11584108">the University of Pennsylvania collection</a> that hadn’t been tagged yet!)</p>
