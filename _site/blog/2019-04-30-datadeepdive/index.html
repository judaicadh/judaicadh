<p><strong>Charakteres</strong> is a term used for ancient ritual signs. These magical signs appear in all languages, with inscribed artifacts (amulets), ritual instruction manuals, and literary sources. Researchers find them across the ancient Mediterranean world — <a href="https://charakteres.com/">The Charakteres Project</a>, led by Kirsten Dzwiza at the University of Heidelberg, focused on Greek, Demotic, Latin and Coptic sources dated between the 1st and the 12th centuries CE.</p>

<p>Finding fragments with charakteres in the Cairo Geniza tells us how widespread magical practice was among Jewish communities, and how these signs crossed geographical and linguistic boundaries to be a part of different cultures. Many researchers have taken interest into the charakteres of the Geniza, paying particular attention to how these signs were used and for what purpose/function on these fragments.</p>

<p>In the sorting phase, 71 subjects were tagged as having #charakteres. You can see all the subjects by volunteered with charakteres <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/judaicadh/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/talk/tags/charakteres">here</a> — we have highlighted a few of interest below.</p>

<p>Subject 21714563 is one of Geniza amulets included in <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000407251"><em>Amulets and Magic Bowls: Aramaic Incantations of Late Antiquity</em></a> by Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked. Made of cloth, this amulet reads below the charakteres:</p>

<p>According to notes from the University of Cambridge University Digital Library, this is an amulet for Hannah bat Rebecca.
