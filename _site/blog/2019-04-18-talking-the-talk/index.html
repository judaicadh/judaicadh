I wonder whether itâ€™s really evidence of binding, as itâ€™s in the wrong spot for that. I would entertain the idea that it might actually be part of the paper itself. Hemp cords and other not-very-processed textile material was used to make cheaper paper. @citsci-rancho: Is the cord actually part of the paper, or kind of embedded in it? The back side of the subject is a shrek! (quoting my mother here) It looks like it was lying in mud, and hasnâ€™t been cleaned. Also, is this subject actually printed, as the label says? The letters donâ€™t look uniform. I would have thought that this was a manuscript. @stefriegel: I can see from an enlargement of the torn edge that the paper itself contains some textile material. The fibres are very small. The long cord mentioned above however looks very different from those fibres and looks typically more like the binding cords we have seen in other subjects. It is in the wrong spot for an egde binding, but it would be in the right place for corner binding, as known for connecting some pages of legal documents together. See e.g. subject 21708006 for comparison. Also note the diagonal fold close to the cord in both subjects. I agree with @citsci-rancho that the letters look handwritten, not printed. @mrustow: Right you are: corner binding. I had no idea. Thank youâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis is blowing my mind. I knew there were various methods of binding, especially for archival registers, but Iâ€™d never seen this one.
